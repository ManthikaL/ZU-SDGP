I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....  \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.  \n",
       "2       I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.  \n",

The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back.

I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....   \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.   \n",
       "2  I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.   \n",

The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop.   \n",

If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....   \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.   \n",
       "2   I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.   \n",

As I was speaking the rep noticed I was breaking up to much, so he told me the phone was a 2G..and most likely did not work well in my area. So he was kind enough to send be a 3.5G phone model SC-628..This one seems to be working fine...so far but I must say it was the best customer service response to solve the issue....   \n",

Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.  \n",
       "2   I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.  \n",

As I was speaking the rep noticed I was breaking up to much, so he told me the phone was a 2G..and most likely did not work well in my area. So he was kind enough to send be a 3.5G phone model SC-628..This one seems to be working fine...so far but I must say it was the best customer service response to solve the issue....  "

I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....   \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.   \n",
       "2  I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.   \n",

The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop.   \n",

       "2  I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son  I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn t clear  I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn t clear  I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn t clean  I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone  I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN   so that I could call and make sure it was clear  I was told that they didn t have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear  I should ve known something was wrong then  I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN  The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn t clear  So once again I had to send another phone back  I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn t have a clear ESN  I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping  I wouldn t suggest you buy anything from them   \n",

       "2  i purchased this phone in december as a christmas present to my son  i called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the esn wasn t clear  i was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn t clear  i reached out to this company to inform them that this esn wasn t clean  i was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone  i asked the representative to provide me with the esn   so that i could call and make sure it was clear  i was told that they didn t have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear  i should ve known something was wrong then  i received a second phone that turned out not have a clear esn  the representative at sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the esn isn t clear  so once again i had to send another phone back  i asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn t have a clear esn  i received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping  i wouldn t suggest you buy anything from them   \n",

I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....   \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.   \n",
       "2  I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.   \n",

I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....   \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.   \n",
       "2  I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.   \n",

I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....   \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.   \n",
       "2  I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.   \n",

The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop.   \n",

I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....   \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.   \n",
       "2  I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.   \n",

The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop.   \n",

I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER....   \n",

The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.   \n",
       "2  I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.   \n",

The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop.   \n",
