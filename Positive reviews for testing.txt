Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase.

Lot of new features added in this new iPhone, night mode is improved, and a satisfactory battery back upWorth every penny!

You can get good phones for cheaper. You can also get phones with certain features that you don’t get here. But if you are looking for the most well rounded phone that ticks all the right boxes with sheer simplicity, this is for you.
