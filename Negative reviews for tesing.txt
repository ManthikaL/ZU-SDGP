Face id not proper working Bluetooth fully not working after 20days date of purchasing.

After costing a huge amount iPhone 12 will not support 5G mmWave in India, which is the fastest 5G. So, before purchasing be cautious about the fact..

Not worth the money, I think apple deliberately selling inferior products to India. All 5 star ratings are from apple fanboys who are interested in Instagram pictures (since camera is only good ). I request people to buy only Samsung as they are truly "smartphone". plus their strong make in india commitment. Never heard of any violence in samsung factories.

If you are planning to buy an iphone then please buy from stores only.I got a defective product and when I complain about it to amazon customer care and requested for replacement they simply deny to replace it.Don't waste your money.

Phones below 10knhabe better displays.Good camera but not the best.Just another marketing skill every fool falls for everyday
