"I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it. Scroll bar can be set to purple, pink, aqua, orange, etc. Overall: Okay phone. It serves its purpose but definitely pales in comparison to these new phones coming out from Sprint. Why get so so when you can get great?"
"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out. Innovation in money-making at its finest."
"This is a great, reliable phone. I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones. All they need are covers in a reasonable price range..."
"I love the phone and all, because I really did need one, but I didn't expect the price of the bill when I received one. Also, I've had my phone for a little over two months now and still have yet to receive my free accessories that were supposed to come with the phone. Every time I call the company, they keep telling me to wait a couple of weeks, and that I should be receiving it shortly. Other than that, I do love the phone and all that I am able to do with it; and I'm not just talking about making the phone calls! :)"
"The phone has been great for every purpose it offers, except the day i bought it-i couldnt get the case off. You can take the case off to put your own pictures in the jaket which is super cool, but when i took it back to the store-an employee said they were meant to be hard to get off. Well, he could barely even get it off- he came close to snapping the casing in half. I was never able to get it off after that which isnt THAT big of a deal, but it got dirty under the clear casing and it looks really dirty now. MAKE SURE YOU CAN GET YOUR CASE ON AND OFF! Oh and you have to charge it ALL off the time."
"Hello, I have this phone and used it until I decided to buy a flip phone. I have had NO problems with the battery or new cases--it has a new fish case on it now and it stays as well as the original one. I have added ring tones, and music so it was all good for me--as a matter of fact I am willing to sell this phone, the home charger and the car charger for a great deal--email me--(...)"
"Cool. Cheap. Color: 3 words that describe the Nokia 3588 perfectly. I mean, what more DO you want? This beauty's got classic, sleek looks that jerks you a little about a Nokia 3310's looks. The 3588 also has some amazing ringtones. And I own a cellphone shop, so I have the experience. I RATE THIS THE 5TH BEST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS IN MY STORE. Do you need more prompting to buy this, pal? Well, then here it comes!: The Nokia 3599 includes an alarm clock, calendar, voice recorder, calculator and stopwatch . And trust me, its good value for money if you're on a tight budget. And oh, if you're thinking of getting this for a teenager, you've come to the right phone; they'll go crazy after its looks AND its color LCD (which happens to be a little oversize). If this phone's goin' for an adult, you've hit da soda pop again, you lucky person! NOW are ya convinced that this mobile's REAL! (it is)."
"The 3599i is overall a nice phone, except that Nokia made its universal headset jack incompatible with most 2.5mm universal headsets (even their own). A phone call to tech support was required to find out that you need to buy a headset that plugs into the Pop-port accessory connector on the bottom of the phone. They ended up suggesting the HDB-5 headset."
"I've never owned a Nokia phone before, so this is a first for me. I really like the phone alot, the reception is great...even though the signal strength show's being low. The quality of the phone is great too, it feels sturdy and weighted. I highly recommend this phone."
ok well im in school and i need the text messaging and ive had this phone for about a month and text messaging was supposed to start working 2weeks ago.A conflict of software type stuff and btween nokia and sprint.(Its down to 4 stars) And the fact it cant download ringtones.(3stars)Or games(2 stars)But you cant beat a nearfree or free color phone(back to 3 stars) as soon as it gets text messaging it should b 4 stars.
"I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway? I just reccommend buying a protective case for it and leaving it on and don't drop the delicate thing."
"1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone. This one will only make you cry at night."
"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them."
This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.
DON'T BUY OUT OF SERVICE
I have been with nextel for nearly a year now I started out this time last year with the Motorola i205 and just upgraded to the i265 it is one of the best phones I have ever had the service is the best I have ever had I have no problems making or reciving calls. If you are considering nextel give it a shot they are in my opinion the best cell company out there.
"I just got it and have to say its easy to use, i can hear the person talking just fine and i have had no problems dealing with nextel."
1 star because the phones locked so I have to pay additional fees to unlock it
The product has been very good. I had used this cell phone in one of my projects and it worked wonders. I will definitely recommend this to anyone interested in buying it....
"My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did."
GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS AS GREAT FOR NEXTEL AS IT IS FOR BOOST INSERT YOUR SIM & GO!
"I bought this phone to replace an LG phone that I didn't like. As I expected, all I had to do was put the old SIM card in the new phone and it worked. There are two serious drawbacks to this device, both related to the candy bar style. First, all the buttons are exposed, so it's easy to hit one accidentally. Second, the screen is easily scratched. This one got scratched making it difficult to read in sunlight. Aside from those two flaws, the phone works great. Connectivity, battery life, and quality of voice are superb. Since I don't do texting I can't comment on that. It is nice and small, and if it came with a case, or if I could find a case for it, then it would be perfect for my needs. The price was right. Now I have a new SIM card with $10 worth of calling on it that I don't need."
"I purchased this phone for my AT&T phone replacement, even though one of the FAQ mentioned it works with AT&T SIM, in my case, it didn't. Since this is my primary phone, in stead of spending time to see the reason, I'll go with other phone, which specifically says it's ""unlocked""."
The phone did not come with a charger and didn't have a sims card.
SERVED ME WELL AS A BACK UP PHONE.
I got this phone just as secondary cell phone. It is really lightweight and very cheap. The receiption is good. But most of the time a windy noise is heard when somebody is calling to this cell phone.
Sturdy - clarity is great - easy to use Only problem - no Speaker option...... Big issue for me but im living with it atm.
Phone stoped working
It does a beautiful job. I have used this item with my att account. its good to see my bill so little and avoided big amount of bills..i would recommend this product to any body. Very good quality it really met my expectations
way too small
"I asked my friend to toss me my phone, but what he heard was ""Hey, throw that phone as hard as you can at my head"", so he did. Hit me square in the temple and I dropped. Needless to say this is a very sturdy phone, very simple and easy to use, long battery life (Like really long, like Stretch Armstrong long), takes being dropped and smacked around like a champ. If this phone was my son, i'd be proud, and afraid. The texting takes a little to get used to, but I digress. Smart Phones are for dummies. P.S you can create your own ringtones on this phone, provides way more entertainment than Flappy Bird."
"We never use cell phones, but thought we needed one for a long road trip. With our last phone we were always irritated that the battery seemed to be dead every time we tried to use it. Based on reviews, we chose this phone. Battery life is great! And the phone really does handle abuse very well. My husband forgot it was in his shirt pocket. The phone went through the washer and dryer and still works as well as ever!! I'm not sure how it would work as an everyday phone, but for those who only need it occasionally I would highly recommend. It will be there, charged and ready when you need it."
"I have had this model phone for 4-1/2 years and only now the battery is beginning to fail. FANTASTIC little phone that doesn't drop calls, can stick in a pocket or purse easily, does exactly what it is supposed to do at an unbeatable price. Refill for $100 and get a bonus $5."
"Easy to use features, slim in size at a very good price. It is better compare to my exsiting T-Mobile prepaid phone. I called from a landline to both phones and the at& t picked up within 13 seconds while the T-Mobile at 25 sec or most of the time, just jumped to my voice mail only. I highly recommend at&t."
"This phone is great. Simple to use, great battery life, always has a strong signal and AT&T has a great pay-as-you go plan. I'm happy."
It is just a basic phone and is an effective phone for people who do not need a lot of features. The size is good.
"this is a good little inexpensive phone - basic, but that's what I wanted! Just a phone for my pay as you go plan!"
"I almost never write reviews for anything, but this stupid little cheap phone has proven so reliable and indestructible that I just had to say something. I bought this phone at least 3 (maybe 4) years ago, after two ""fancy"" (expensive) flip phones each lasted less than a year before falling apart. My goal was not to buy a phone that would last 4 years (I didn't expect any phone would) and certainly was not to buy a $20 phone that would last 4 years. My goal was just not to spend $150 on another phone. I hoped it might last 6 months, until I decided what to do next (change service providers, get a new contract with a free phone, etc.) To my surprise, this little brick of a phone just keeps going. It has not been treated lightly (I recently opened up the back to find the serial #, and found it full of dirt & dust). It has crashed with me skiing, been splashed with salt water while sailing, and been drenched in sweat while in my bike jersey. Still, it works. Complaints: I dearly wish it had a camera, even a crappy one. Sometimes the exposed buttons get pressed accidentally. It has no fancy features. But I'm going to buy another one-- just in case this one ever quits. UPDATE 1/1/12: This phone is still going. 5+ years now. I bought this phone when the first-generation iPhone came out. Four generations of iPhone later, I still don't have one, because this phone has refused to die. Incredible."
"I have had the C168i for two years as a replacement for a different phone I broke. Note that it is a ""goPhone"" but you can use any monthly ATT service with it just by putting your SIM card in. My friends make fun of me for my boring looking phone, but they have since gone through 4-5 $150-200 phones while my $20 ""crap"" phone is still going and going... This phone is perfect for someone who doesn't need a camera, videos, bell and whistles stuff, but wants a sturdy reliable phone with a long battery life. It is also very inexpensive. Also, I attest to the main review that this phone is a ""TERMINATOR"" phone, meaning it is EXTREMELY resistant to almost all forms of physical harm. I have never tried soaking it in water, but I have dropped it, thrown it, scraped it, kicked it etc. and the screen and battery are still perfectly functional. Great battery life as well. My battery has NEVER run out on me. EVER! And I am super-negligent when it comes to charging it. Of course, the phone really only has normal calling and basic texting. The only complaint I would make is that entering new contacts into the address book is somewhat difficult and counter-intuitive until you learn how to do it. You won't regret buying this phone."
"I've been using this phone for about three weeks, now, and it truly is a nice little phone. It's small, light, and the keypad and screen really light up...you can actually see the screen in very bright sunlight! It does everything I want a phone to do. The graphics on the web are really very good, although accessing the web is rather slow. The keypad IS quite small, and this could be a problem for most men, but it's perfect for me. The only negative is that it doesn't have speaker phone capability. The battery life is, as the others have said, amazing! As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on. I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on. It's a simple matter of pushing two keys to turn on the lock or to shut it off, and sure saves a lot of battery life."
"Well, my phone that came with my service plan is.. well.. its now a paper weight (darn razrs!!) I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone. The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something. I highly recommend this phone. I'm going to buy another one soon, heck I might even pick up 2 one for an emergency replacement."
"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about). And it does look pretty good as a paper weight."
"I needed a temporary phone for a friend in a retirement home until he got settled in his new place. I charged it up and it ran for several days on its own. He would have preferred a larger key pad due to his poor eyesight, but he seemed to do okay with it, and it was simple enough for him to be able to use it to simply make or receive calls (I didn't get into the answering system with him!). Now that he has moved and has his landline installed, I am giving it to a friend who has no cell phone, and cannot afford the price of a regular one. This will be just right for her limited calls when she is on the road. So.... two for the price of one!!"
"This phone isn't kidding when it says military specs. I had a hole in my pocket and it went tumbling down a flight of concrete steps (20 steps). It had a few scratches but it worked fine. It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one. My only pet peeve with this phone is they could have at least given me ONE full game - not the lame demos that are included with it. The phone itself is about the size of a Hershey bar. I often keep it in my pants pocket (the front pocket)."
I bought this phone and found out IDEN phones with sim cards are no longer eligible for service with Boost Mobile. So buyer be ware dont buy these unless you already have service with a sim card.
i wont ( enter special code )
my mother said that she loves Walkie Talkie Phones so what i did was i bought this for my mother Denise Avellan for mothers day of 2014 and my mother loves it. what a great Direct Connect Connection!!!!!!
Bought this phone only to be told it would no longer work on network. Waste of money and seller knew they would not work and did not say anything.
For the price you really get a solid boost motorola phone. Sounds and looks good.
"PHONE DID NOT COME WITH A SIM CARD....INFORMATION I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE..... PHONE WORKS FINE, BUT BECAUSE PTT (WALKIE) IS BEING PHASED-OUT ON BOOST, NO SIM. RATING IS FOR PHONE, BUT VERY UNHAPPY NOT TO HAVE ALL THE FACTS PRIOR TO PURCHASE."
"This is not a ""boost"" phone and will not work as a GPS with Boost. Had to send it back. A huge pain for something that is $24. This is a rip-off."
good phone works well. very simple to use.dropped a few times and still works fine.
"You get the basic functions for what a cell phone is needed for, in other words this phone is simple and effective."
Wouldn't know anything about the cell phone I ordered because the person hasn't even shipped it yet. It's been a month! And amazon has does nothing to help and really has nothing for an option to provide assistance.
"For someone needing a very basic phone and services (i.e., no email access, no camera, etc.) this phone is quite good. The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow. Hence if you need to use such a feature this phone is far from optimal. All and all a very good phone despite the weaknesses cited above. If someone is looking for a barebones phone this is more than fulfills the requirements."
"I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with? I deeply regret selecting to business with this company."
"I picked this up to use with Boost Mobile. All I wanted was a phone with walkie talkie and this fit the bill. I have a digital camera for pictures, phones don't need a camera. This phone has not dropped one call since I activated it. Everytime I DT with someone it works. This phone gets a signal where T-Mobile, Sprint and all others fail. The buttons for texting and replying to emails are easy to handle. If you are looking for a ""phone"" this is the one to get. I would give this 10 starts if it were allowed. Another plus is it handles mp3's & GIF images which I upload from my own PC to the phone."
"This phone is awesome. I have one through Boost Mobile with the unlimited plan. Bought it on August 6th and no regrets. People that whine and complain about the screen res or no games. It's a phone people, nothing more, nothing less. I use the walkie-talkie regularly, my wife and I text back and forth daily with no missed or missing messages. This phone receives/makes calls and walkie-talkie's where others have failed. If people want games buy a Gameboy, want pictures buy a camera, not real hard to figure out. This little gem was built to be a phone and that's exactly what it is. In short.... See it as it really is, a phone."
"i dont want to sound like a hot head but i havent had the best luck with cell phones, when i get a bad call the phone goes flying. this phone has impressed me with its durablity, i have thrown it, droped it and it even went flying out of my cars window while on the street when i wasnt looking, and it still works. best phone i ever bought. why would you buy a phone that cost $400 and worry every time you drop it, when if this one falls you just brush off the dirt and go on your way."
"I find texting impossible on this phone. As another reviewer said, the screen goes blank randomly and you have to turn it off and on again. Also the phone randomly turns off phone transmissions and you have to turn it back on to receive/make phone calls. There has to be better phones out there."
"I recently had an i776 which was ruined at work. I had good service with it and it worked well. I spent $50 on this piece, the service is horrible, very patchy. I don't receive texts, sometimes the screens goes white for no reason. The key pad lights stopped working, the phone has no alarm. The battery doesn't last more than a day. I have only had to phone for two months. Its the worst phone ive owned, do not buy this. The i776 is a good phone,but you have to buy the rugged version."
I LOVE THIS PHONE! YES I WOULD LOVE IT TO HAVE MORE FEATURES BUT I LOVE THIS PHONE! THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT! I COULD BE DOING LAUNDRY AND BE TALKING IN SPEAKER AND HEAR AND BE HERD PERFECTLY WITHOUT THE ECKO MOST PHONES MAKE TO WHO EVER IS LISTENING TO YOU THE WEB IS NORMAL LIKE ANY OTHER PHONE THE TEXING IS GOOD ASS WELL OVERALL THIS PHONE WON ME OVER WITH ITS SOUND QUALITY IVE HAD SO MANY PHONES VERY LOW ON SOUND THIS PHONE IS PERFECT I HAD THE OTHER PHONE THE $[...]. ONE BUT UPGRADED TO THIS ONE AND LOVE IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE ITS VERY EASY TO TIPE THE BUTTONS ARE NOT HARD AT ALL LOVE THIS PHONE.
"This phone is JUNK. Do NOT buy this phone. You will have much faster messaging via regular USPS. Your text messages will be lost in the vast time warp of boost mobilism where they will stay until you decide to try to use the internet on this phone. While waiting the regular 15 minutes for a webpage to load, you will be bumrushed by a million of delayed texts which will obliterate all the efforts this sorry little phone has put forth in trying to load the webpage. The screen will turn white and the entire phone will reset on its own. You will then have the responsibility of manually turning your transmitters back on for the phone to work again. If you are arguing with a girlfriend on this phone, she will dump you because she will think you have hung up on her. If you have close family members, they will abandon you and make pacts with other family members not to call or text you because you never text back and hardly ever answer. If you are having an affair with a married woman, this phone will hold all the messages you sent to her until her husband has come home. Then, like magic, this phone will deliver all the long lost messages as soon as he picks up his wife's phone. They should reaname this phone the i666. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for this phone, but common sense makes one wonder if it wasn't created by a more sinister power. Possibly Satan himself."
it withstands a lot and is worth the money only thing IT DOESNT HAVE A CAMERA
"This was a replacement for the one my mom had that went south on us. Can't really complain about it because the problem with this device is the carrier not the phone. Probably should give it five stars because the seller gave a spot on description, gave a charger, and threw in a case for free but yet again my carrier doesn't seem to like the phone. I did receive this package next day."
"The shipping time on the phone was great, The phone also works great and as it is supose to, My sims card had no problems as some stated theirs did, great battery life, nice looking phone. Work in a area that my other phone had no signal this phone does when clear out, Not so good when cloudy, But would buy again from seller. Thank you Mark"
Purchased 2 and one worked....
Delivered as promised.
"They are showing a cingular phone which is identical to the one that I had ,Instead I got an AT&tT.It is okay but yhe cingular phone has more options."
"My wife loves this phone, it is her third one like it. This one is perfect for her. Thanks."
"this phone was the one my husband got when we first opened our cell account many years ago. He is not open to change and I wasn't sure i could get this phone again. I am very glad I was able to get it for him, and it is working quite well. Thank you."
"I got this phone because I wanted a phone that would have better reception than my previous phone. However, it never recognized any of the information stored on my SIM card, so it was essentially useless to me."
"The phone was purchased through an 'Alpha Wireless' supposedly in Texas but shipped from a 'Go Green Wireless' out of Florida. While I understand that several companies may cooperate to fulfill orders it does make it difficult regarding recourse when, in this case, a phone was represented as 'New' and simply was not. The price paid should have more closely reflected the condition. Buyer beware as usual when using Amazon or Ebay."
"It's a nice phone only if it worked properly. I can answer the phone but can't hear the person on the line I have to put the phone on speaker in order to hear, this causes people to hang up because the phone's a piece of junk. this started happen two days after I got the phone.....a bad choice."
Very satisfied
If you are looking for regular phone that's fairly durable this is great! Especially if used in heavy case? Yes I would recommend this phone
"Short: This phone works fine as a basic phone, if that is all you are looking for. Long: My old phone's LCD croaked on me, and I wanted to wait a bit before buying an HTC Dream, so I went with this cheap phone. Complaints: Menu/key response is sometimes slow. No way to get data to phone via USB cable, at least if you live in the US. It seems like a USB cable exists (in Europe, Asia and Australia) but it costs about as much as the phone itself does after exchange rates. If you go to [...], they talk about cable CA-126, which works with the 1680. It has a regular usb connector on one end, and a Nokia microusb & 2.5mm charger plug on the other. The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for ""authorized personal only"", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method. In any event, I'll be getting a new phone in a few months so I'll live with this phone for now. But the limitations it has makes it so that it is only suitable for those who are not looking for anything other than making/receiving phone calls (like my parents)."
"The good news is that it has a long battery life and is lightweight. But none of that is worth anything if you cant hear the other person. I had a Samsung and a Sony before and never had this problem. The keypad is tough, requiring sledge hammer to push the keys. Bottom line: the phone is cheap, but you get what you pay for. Try Sony or Samsung, their cheapest models work better than this."
"I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example. Overall, I like this phone, and will probably keep it until I someday feel the need to get a smartphone-type slab of electronics."
"This is probably the wrost experience i had with Amazon and it costed me $72.00. Both my phones from amazon arrived inright time but without activation. I called AT&T and they could not locate our phone numbers so had to call back amazon and learned that they have not activated our phones. Amazon customer service took good amount of time to do this meanwhile i missed by billing cycle with old cell phone company. This process took about a week, and not to mention the SIM card delivered was not working and amazon had to ship again."
"By simple I mean that in a good way, having come from an Envy 2 I am glad to be able to open the phone and dial and not have to deal with clicking OK twice to unlock the ""locked"" screen. Quotes intentional, the screen was only locked when I needed to urgently make a call but had a lot of phantom dialing while in my pocket. So back to the Alias 2 the phone is easy to figure out but does not work in all the ways it is said to work. Specifically I can not get this phone to pair with my blue tooth in my new car. I tried, the car dealer tried and while NO issues are reported with this phone and its blue tooth capabilities I beg to differ! I read another review of a person who had exact same trouble with a different model car and was also told the phone is fine. It is obviously something unique to this model only because other samsung phones pair without problems. I got my phone exchanged and after going through that it still will not pair with my car. I wanted this phone because it is simpler than the previous envy 2 I owned but even that phone will pair with my car. I plan to switch to a smart phone as soon as the Nexus One comes to verizon. Considering the very large increase in the monthly charges they will thus receive and extending my contract I sincerely hope they work as hard to keep the customer happy as they say they do. This customer is not terribly happy right now! I will say that the network is the strongest for my area so I hope to stick with verizon but can and will change if they wont try and keep me satisfied."
"Just recently got this phone as a replacement to my i760 and am happy to be back to a flip phone. Great Camera, have not tested video yet. Battery life is solid. I'll give samsung credit for the rotating/changable keyboard, a cool thing for the next model might be a customizable keyboard where you have the ability to assign values to each key. As far as ease of use for the keyboard...I havent had any problems and I have large hands/fingers. It takes a little getting used to but once acclimated you should have no problems. I cant comment on voice recognition or blue tooth as I dont really use those features and honestly find them useless (once in a while I'll use my ear piece in the car but its rare). I also dont plan on using it as an MP3 player...I have an ipod for that. If your looking for a phone to synch with outlook then find one where that is offered in the specs. Yes you can remotely sync and get access to web email but nowhere in the description is outlook mentioned so I cant hold that against the phone. It would be like faulting my car cause it doesnt fly (I know thats an exageration but its kinda the same thing) when its clearly not meant for that. If you need a phone that syncs with outlook then get a pda phone. This is basically your standard flip with a few extra features and probly wont be as popular with the mickey mouse club kids that want an iPhone like device that they can watch movies on and giggle over the txts their friends just sent. Interface is about the same as any other VZ flip phone I've had in the past. The ability to use a 16gb micro sd is also a nice feature and is especially handy if you have a card reader on your pc/laptop. All in all its a solid phone that serves the purpose its intended for...a phone thats easy to txt on and make calls on."
"Good overall phone, bluetooth so far syncs well with the integrated bluetooth in a Mercedes that I used to have and also with the aftermarket Alpine stereo that I have in my VW. But some of the features and design are just poor and/or not thought out. Looks great but the body is far too slippery. It's like handling a bar of soap. I use it as my primary alarm clock in the morning and it's really clumsy to grab off the nightstand and shut off the alarm. Even when I'm fully awake and alert :-) it's hard to open and I've dropped it a few times while fumbling to open it. There is a wider slit on the clamshell lid to fit your finger into when opening in portrait mode but in landscape mode there's no place to insert your finger to flip it open, so you have to use your fingernail. Unlike my previous phone, it takes two hands almost all the time to open this thing whereas my old phone I could easily flip it open with one hand. I wish the alarm clock's snooze function was like most clock radios where it allows 10 minutes snooze time, not 5. 5 is just too short. Or, the phone should allow you to set the snooze period as a preference. There is no way to display the time on the front screen when the phone is dark; you have to open it up. Well, you can fake it by holding the lock button for the music keys, which will light up the display) but then you have to hold it a second time to reset the lock/unlock back to where you had it. Also, when you're on a call (although just about every cell phone fails on this) the clock doesn't display anywhere (so this is no better than other phones). How many times have you been on a call and said ""Hey let's meet later!"" and the person asks you ""Ok, what time is it now?"" and you can't tell. (I quit wearing watches because of the clocks on cell phones...but why don't they display the time when on a call?) The keys on the outside aren't too bad except the volume up/down is a little too easy to accidentally press. I like the keyboard idea overall but I find it's like typing on little Chiclet gum candies. I need to use my fingernails to avoid fat-fingering it. In QWERTY mode, the END button is too close to the space bar and I have inadvertantly killed my web browser when typing a space in a field on a page. Frustrating! With the END key was farther away. Wish they would have also engineered in some page up/down keys too, as scrolling line by line is cumbersome. I would also like the END and SEND keys to somehow be the traditional red and green colors too. I use Outlook on my netbook to ""sync"" (sort of) my contacts to the phone. This works alright but if you want to refresh your contacts you have to delete them all from the phone and then resend them over or they'll be duplicates. This is a bit annoying only in that you will then need to re-enter the ICE contacts manually. The bluetooth can send pics to my netbook, but only one at a time (cumbersome). Can't select multiple photos at once. Won't send videos at all to my netbook via Bluetooth. Have to send them via a picture message to email and fake it that way but you incur data usage charges doing it that way. Or you can use removable storage on the MicroSD card to do it. The biggest disappointment is the calendar. What a useless piece of junk! It says you can send calendar appointments to the phone, which you can, but it is half-baked. If you set a reminder in Outlook, the reminder doesn't carry over to the phone. The phone only supports one text field for the appointment and it corresponds to the Outlook appointment body (not the header meeting description nor location), so I have to retype the description and location in the Outlook calendar body if I want to see anything useful on the phone. Even then, some appointments come over with an empty text field on the phone (it is either a problem with the text being too long and/or having a carriage return in the text I think). So if I try to then enter it on the phone (enter the description in the displayed (and empty) text field), the phone freezes and then reboots. Terrible! The recurring meeting also is miserably half-baked. You cannot set an interval like ""every other week"". I work a 9/80 work schedule and I want to have every other Friday that I work in my phone so I know when I'm off work or not. I can only choose daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. So while it does take Outlook calendar items, they end up so flawed and useless that if you really do plan on using this phone as an organizer, don't; it will fail to meet your needs. I understand that Samsung uses this same calendar in many of its products and if so, it will be a deal breaker next time around for me and I'll shop a different brand. The add-on Mobile Email from OZ isn't too bad but it also has room for improvement. It is billed as ""fully integrated"" but not in my eyes. While the phone itself has a limited file viewer for certain file types stored on it, if you receive an email with attachments (even if just a .jpg), the OZ mobile email doesn't support accessing attachments. This is not what I call ""fully integrated"". The OZ email client also works a bit inconsistently (although maybe it's an issue with the email providers and not OZ?). With my Cox POP3 accounts, I can only access the inbox (not sent items). With Yahoo and Hotmail, I can access the various folders OK. With my university's email account (hosted by Google GMAIL), it displays both the inbox and the sent items in the inbox (really weird, and I imagine if I had other folders it might lump everything togeter as well). The user interface for the OZ mobile email isn't too bad although it was a bit unintuitive to find how to add a recipient to an email from the phone's contacts. Can be done but just was hard to find. Also isn't clear on how to add multiple recipients (use a comma or semicolon between them? don't know...) Beware of Verizon's compusory data plan with this phone. It is misleading. Supposedly for $9.99 a month you get 25MB of data usage. This often isn't presented clearly. It applies only to the web browser. Texting and picture messaging are not part of this 25MB **even though they use a data connection!**. It should be called a ""web browsing plan"", not a ""data plan"". So unless you pay for an additional texting plan, you will be charged for each message. I was pretty furious when my first bill arrived to find I was charged for the picture messages I sent thinking it was part of my ""data plan"". The mp3 player is alright although once or twice it froze up on me and I had to restart the phone. The headphone jack is a nontypical 2.5mm so you will need an adapter to go to 3.5mm. Booooo. Battery life is so-so. If at work I listen to mp3s during the day and also do a little lunchtime web browsing for about 10-15 minutes, I can easily go from a full battery to dead in about 5-6 hours. I don't know if this is typical or not of most phones, but it'd be nice if the mp3s can make it through one whole workday, but it can't. Sound on the built-in speakers is decent for something so small."
"I loved my Samsung Alias, as most Alias owners do. I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place. Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad). I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original. I will keep my new every 2 discount until Verizon comes out with a very good Android or Apple finally relents with the iphone/At&T exclusivity."
"I've gone through several phones in the last few years - whenever my rebates would apply I would upgrade. Last year I settled on the Alias 2, mostly because of the e-ink technology. I was impressed at first but the excitement of the new phone wore off as it always does. Regardless, it remains a trustworthy phone. Hopefully Samsung's newer versions of the Alias will fix a few flaws that I've run into, not the least of which is a slow system. When you're in the middle of typing a text and a new text comes in, the phone freezes momentarily before saving the text-in-progress in a draft and showing you the new text. The fact that the phone saves the text is good - but it would be better if the incoming text flew to the background and the phone allowed you to continue your typing. I've had to learn that when I'm typing a text and the phone stops registering what I'm trying to enter, I have to stop pushing buttons. If you give it a second, it'll resume normal running - otherwise, you might accidentally delete the incoming text. The same goes for trying to take a picture while a text comes in - except the picture doesn't save. Occasionally the phone gets confused - if you flip from landscape to vertical positions too fast, the keys and screen don't change, even after you push a few buttons. It continues to operate as if it were in vertical mode, even though the phone is flipped to the normal position. I like that I can switch from vertical to horizontal and back while in the middle of a text, but this only works if you flip fast enough (there's plenty of time - plus if you close the phone and don't flip fast enough, it simply saves your draft) and doesn't apply to any application other than an in-progress text. There's a decent signal with the Alias 2 - my previous phone was a cheap-o so I noticed an improvement in the signal but I can't verify that it's better than the enV or Omnia or other higher-end phone. If you're considering this phone, take into consideration that none of the cases, including the slimmest clear plastic ones, fit very well on the dual-hinge. They don't prevent the phone from opening, but they do cause a strain on the hinge when flipped in landscape mode and they make phone bulkier than necessary. In terms of size, it has a great feel. It's probably a little bit taller than most phones (about the size of the enV Touch and the orignal enV) but it's very slim and definitely pocket-sized. The keyboard, both in landscape and vertical modes, is a great size and perfect for texting. The keys have a unique feel and are not too big and not too small. The front display provides access to your music and taking a picture self-portrait style. (I've seen some complaints that this isn't possible - it is, you have to hold down the play/pause button then the skip-back button to activate the camera. You can see a preview of the picture and simply press the play/pause button again to take the pic.) The front display also allows you to see text message previews and a quick response with the ""Quick texts"" ... You have to have ""Auto-display text"" options set - a feature I didn't discover until I'd had the phone for six or seven months. (Probably should have read the manual!) The volume for the speaker and the mic are good - I haven't had trouble with not being able to hear anyone or with them hearing me. The speaker phone can be a bit crackly if it's up all the way, but full volume is not necessary as it is plenty loud. When the phone is closed, i.e. listening to music - it needs to be up a bit louder and therefore is sometimes crackly but I'm satifisied with it. After all, it's phone, not a iPod dock. All-in-all, this is a great phone with just a few minor problems. I'm still happy with it after the initial novelty has worn off, even though I'm lusting after an enV Touch (just my personal fickleness when it comes to phones!) I'm saving my money, however, and holding onto the trusty Alias 2."
"The messaging features are nice. Typing text messages is not so much of a hassle with the keyboard. Also, the screen is quite pretty. I have found the morphing keyboard to be a great feature. When receiving calls, the phone works over half the time, but it sometimes resets when I attempt to answer calls. Also, at other times it lights up when a call is coming in, but won't actually finish the process and start ringing, so I don't know who actually called until they tell me later. I'm beginning to kick myself for signing a contract for service with this phone, and I suspect that it is going to be a pain in the butt until the contract is up."
"I have been using this phone for a few days now and I like it. I am not a big ""gadget phone"" fan, preferring a simpler device that does just what I want. The voice quality is acceptable and after a short learning cycle is easy to use. The Alias 2 allows me, a novice texter, to send and receive text messages with no real hassles. The keypad is a great size, even for my larger fingers. I would have given 5 stars, except for the learning curve required to figure the phone out. Not that this is bad, but it is definitely different than the older phones I was used to."
"I've had this phone for a couple of months. It's pretty cool in the way the screen and keypad can be used in either portrait or landscape. However, the keys don't have good tactile feedback. I have to type with my fingernail in order to press the keys hard enough and accurately. Its voice recognition software is worthless, so if you are accustomed to using this feature to dial (such as in the car using an earpiece), don't bother. The camera and camcorder work very well and the quality of the pictures and display are really good. The battery in this phone doesn't last near as long as my old LG, however this phone has many more features, so I think the battery life is acceptable. It's got a sleek design and it's fun to use, however, I don't think I'd buy another one because of the usability issues."
"My Alias 2 keeps shutting off, even with a full charge. I thought it might be a problem with my battery until my husband's phone started doing the same thing...several times a day! Since then, we have heard of two other people having the same problem with the Alias 2. The local Verizon store offered a software update, but with no guarantee that it would correct the problem. They claim that this phone wasn't a big seller, and they have never heard of this problem before. They refuse to look into the problem, saying that's just the nature of electronic devices...no guarantees. Anyone else having this problem?"
"Had a Samsung A-310 for 6 years...a die-hard, sturdy phone. Wanted the same, with improved features. Looked for a flip phone (no purse-calling) that was intuitive, and had decent-sized keys to start texting - and this is it. You have SOOOO much room, because the keyboard changes with your need. Easy to use - intuitive for basic functions. If you choose to read the manual, there is a LOT more there. It's wonderful - thanks Samsung!!!"
"Overall I like the phone for its call quality. I love the keyboard and find it very easy to type text messages. I haven't used the camera or the Bluetooth features. I can access my email accounts easily. The main problem with the phone is that locks up when I attempt to use the MP3 player. I have an 8GB MicroSD card with all of my music on it. I hook the phone up to my car radio to play it. Everything was fine for the first month, but now the phone locks up or freezes when it's in media mode and the only way to unlock it is to remove and then replace the battery. Very annoying. The phone has also turned off several times when I was attempting to answer a call."
"This is a excellent phone great talk time, excellent standby, very user friendly, I may state it takes a little time to get use to but so does it when you change to new anything. The only down fall is the top 3 keys when your texting when you have large fingers, besides that I would recommend this phone to anybody my wife and kids go through phones like water so had many phones but this one is very unique exspecially with the flip screen. The pictures are excellent minus not having a flash i can live with that cause in low light still takes excellent pics. The flashes on all other phones are a joke those are only good for a couple of foot so take how you want but I recommend this phone for anybody men or women is is very unique. Only gripe is for my wife could be in different colors but my gripe is 3 top buttons could be different thanks for reading Jeff."
"Don't bother with this piece of junk. It is the worst phone I have ever owned. Turns itself off inexplicably 15 times a day. Shuts down in the middle of a conversation. So embarrassing. If you ""close"" it too fast, it shuts down. Also, the body of the phone is way too ""slippery"" --- I have dropped it out of my hand a dozen times only because it's too darn slippery to hold. Impossible to flip open the phone with one hand, you need both hands to open it. Terrible product. I am thinking about quitting Verizon simply because they offer this POS phone. Don't waste your time or money with this junk."
"I got mine for free with the purchase of my wife's blackberry. With the understanding that this is not a full computer, its a great tool tpo give you quick access to the internet. I really don't like working on lap tops, so only own a desktop. This leaves me limited in where I can have access to the internet. This thing gives me access everywhere. I have wireless in the house and I use the broadband everywhere else. Because it is only a netbook it does have its limitations. If you are looking for a full featured machine, this is not for you. But for quick access to the internet and most files, its great."
"Pros: Creative use of buttons, big screen, qwerty keyboard Cons: Doesn't sync with Outlook, clunky user interface, muddled audio in ear piece/speakerphone I really have to give credit to Samsung because of the creatively designed keypad, but I don't recommend this phone overall. The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.) Overall, the phone is designed creatively, but its hip design doesn't make up for its poor UI and lack of features that were essential to me."
never had a problem have had this phone for over 1 year camera takes decent not great pics nice big buttons for texting call quality excellent battery life pretty good all in all a happy camper
Has some real ram issues. It is really unusable. It takes a good 3 minutes just to run a program. I got mine for free for signing up for Fios and I feel like I got ripped off. I thought it would be a nice little thing because we only have 1 computer in my house. But really this can be used for nothing more than a paper weight. DO NOT BUY. I had to give 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option.
"Great phone, which has the comfort of a larger phone, mixed with a very easy to use qwerty keyboard. the keyboard has nice space, and a texture that feels like the kindle. With the touch of a button, the QWERTY turns into 1234, or /?!> ect. Just a need phone, highly recommended."
"I have had this fone for two years, and have not had one problem with it.......love the magic keys.....will wait till the Alias 3 comes out to upgrade and it better have the magic keys!"
I just got this phone a couple days ago and I am in love. It works great. Texting is a breeze. Great size.
"The first time I heard about the Samsung Alias I thought I was in for a unique phone/messaging experience. After all, it contains the E Ink powered keyboard technology where keys can transform from vertical to horizontal and from regular to QWERTY keyboard at the touch of a button and using the dual-flip style that makes this phone more than just the typical flip phone. The first release had its faults, which is why Samsung and Verizon have released the Alias 2. The phone has its improvements. The best one is the fact that, when flipped open sideways, you get enough room to navigate and type with the QWERTY keyboard. The keys are not as crammed in together as the first Alias, for more comfortable typing. The phone also contains GPS, VCast Music with Rhapsody, web e-mail , IM capabilities and a mobile web browser. You can use these features with Verizon's fast EV-DO/3 G network. The phone also has a user-friendly menu and beautiful internal and external display. It's got 80 MB of internal memory (memory expandable to 16 GB with a media card) and a 2 MP camera with some nice, though limited video-recording capabilities. The Alias 2, though an improvement from the original Alias, has its downsides. For one thing, it looks outdated. At a mere glance, it looks like a typical flip phone that's been out for years. It only comes in one color (grayish black), and there's nothing about it that makes it attractive or unique at first glance. The keys are difficult to press. I had to press the keys rather hard every time I used the QWERTY keyboard. My thumbs ached after a while. The OS is quirky. It froze on me quite a few times and I had to do a force reboot. Very annoying when you're in the middle of sending a text message or checking your e-mail. And that's another thing, the calling, or lack thereof. I had about three dropped calls in one day. That's a lot for a phone, especially when I had most if not all network bars. What gives? And last but not least, the phone contains the same old Verizon menu and looks. The only nice thing about it is that you can personalize the internal and external screens with some cute animated wallpaper or other. All in all, the Samsung Alias 2 has all the makings for a popular messaging/multimedia phone. However, I don't think it's quite ready for prime time yet. A slicker design would be nice as well as some improved features and smoother keys. If you're in the bargain for a messaging phone that's stylish as well as functional, and you're in the Verizon network, I strongly recommend the LG enV3 or the enV Touch. You cannot go wrong with those two phones. In the meantime, if you really want this phone, make sure you weigh in the pros and cons before you decide to commit to it for two long years."
"Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: I am NOT a techie nor a tycoon who needs continual internet access lest the global market crash. I need a basic phone, and want a few bells and whistles. I replaced a basic LG cell phone with the Alias2 on the recommendation of a friend. I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page. Pros: I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus. The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time. The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails. It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will. The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures. The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode. It's easy to use. Sound quality is good. Nice long life of battery charge. Cons: The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change. Some functions are difficult to find on the menus. That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu. The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring. There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone. (ETA: Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light. Duh.) This phone was a good choice for me, and I'm very happy with it."
"Calls are fine; battery life is terrific compared to the LG phone I just discarded. Nearly identical software found on every other Verizon phone I've had, yet the standard issue ring tones on this one are pretty bad. Great camera, HOWEVER, no support Bluetooth file system profile -- nor support for marking multiple photos for push, meaning that I have to push each picture painfully and slowly one by one to my PC via Bluetooth. So I should be done pushing the 100 or so pics I took today in about 28 days... lovely. Also, END key is right next to the SPACE key. If you inadvertently tap END while using the mobile web, it exits no matter what/where you are and it is absolutely maddening while you're trying to learn the keypad layout. Time on the front display is permanently set to 12-hr mode. I don't think I'm going to keep this one for long."
"The real standout feature on this phone is keyboard. I made the mistake of assuming that the mp3 bluetooth audio would be at least as good as my original LG chocolate from 3 years ago, especially since verizon just copies its old OS onto everything. The bluetooth stereo is almost unusable, very tinny, no way to adjust the sound profile. If you plug a wire in it sounds great, but not very useful. Phone call quality is ok. it has a spot for upto 16GB card, which would be perfect if it was useful as an MP3 player. If it wasn't too late to return it , I would. Also the Voice recognition is not accurate or useful, something else that used to work flawlessly with my 3yr old chocolate."
"As a teenager, I do a lot of texting. This phone has a great full QWERTY keyboard or if you want, a number pad. The changing keys are cool and people go ooo! and ahh! as they see you flip it both ways. The 2 megapixel camera is good for recording video and photos. There is only a small piece holding the screen to the bottom unit in the corner that seems flimsy from the pictures. It is NOT a flimsy device. This was not a problem. In fact, while walking home on a trail I dropped it without realizing it. The next day I was looking for it all over. When I was walking on the trail I noticed it in the mud. I was mortified because people drive ATV/Quads all over the trail. Upon lifting up the phone I saw that it had been run over and caked in mud. I knew it was not going to work because of how wet it was. Amazingly, it worked fine. I got home and brushed it with a paper towel. It's as good as new. The only problem is that you have to change the keyboard layout in order to get to the numbers. This makes it just as hard to type the number 4 as it is to type four. It's a nice reliable little phone. If you are interested in a standard phone for texting and calling, this is great for you. Pros: Durable Reliable good for texting Cons: A little slow sometimes It's slippery Not a smartphone but it's a cheap one The best secret feature is that if you scratch the back a certain way it makes a cool noise like scratching a record."
"I love the e-ink technology (the qwerty keyboard is great for texting), but that is the highlight. The huge drawback, if you need to make calls with the bluetooth, is that the voice activation system is useless. My old phone worked flawelessly in this area, but with the Alias 2, if I say, ""Call John Smith,"" IF it responds (and many times it doesn't), it will say, ""Did you say dial 123?"" or some other number, or name that is nothing like the one I've said. It's incredibly frustrating. I don't want to look at my phone as I am driving, that is why I rely on the Voice Activation/Bluetooth to make my calls. Without voice activation working properly, I am looking at my phone, scrolling through my address book, and just generally distracted instead of focusing on the road. SO DISAPPOINTING."
"I got this thing and loved it. It is great mini computer for everyday on the go use. Nice size, screen is not too small but not too big either. Keyboard is just as easy to use as a large keyboard. Operating system if you get it in XP works well on this little PC. It does just about everything a large one would do but more portable. I would recommend!"
"My daughter and I both got the LG enV2 about 8 months ago. We're currently waiting for our third version of this. Both phones of our first phones failed within 5 months (keys stopped working on outside, dropped calls, goes back to menu in middle of texting, calls contacts at random times and much more). We got ""new"" ones, which were refurbished phones from Verizon. They lasted a few months before failing with similar problems, plus now I have almost no volume even though its maxed on the setting. We're waiting for our next set of ""new"" phones to arrive later this week. Can't wait to see how long these last. The upgrade to a different phone isn't an option until you've been in the contract one year and can only upgrade one phone then."
Problem: phone was phased out by AT&T so i couldn't even use it or buy sim card or anything for it! AT&T should inform sellers!!
to old
This is the third phone I've purchased for my son since we switched him to AT&T. The first two were the same phone and were no good within a few months. This one has lasted him almost a year now. He likes it and I like not having to replace it all the time.
"thank you so much, and thanks for everything, i need, i want, i love it, its excellent, wonderful, forever thanks"
It's doing good but I was expecting a charger to come with it. I had to get one to fit the phone
It's exactly what I was looking for. Nice and simple. I would recommend this to anyone looking for less technical.
Brand new - out of the box - I charged this phone as instructed (four hours - I gave it six) and when unplugged - black screen. I am returning to Amazon.
like
"Phone came and is okay, but phone was never cleared and had all previous owners information and numbers in it. Not cool."
"We were looking for an attractive, pre-paid cell phone and this fit the bill. It's easy to use, has good battery life, and includes a serviceable camera. The phone is comfortable to use (something that couldn't be said for the Motorola flip phones), snaps closed with a solid feel, and the menus are straightforward. Call quality with AT&T is very good. There are two things that could be improved: there should be a way to get photos off the phone without having to send a video text message, and it would be nice to be able to import phone numbers from a PC. For the price though it's no big deal. Other than those quibbles we're very happy with the phone."
"If you are looking for something simple that has great call quality this is the phone. I researched low SAR (absorbed radiation) and this was the cheapest most simple phone available. My other phone was ancient, so this feels like a huge step up. Love the speakerphone, internal antenna. The camera doesn't take super clear pictures, but my other phone didn't have a camera at all - so still a step up. Overall pleased with how it functions and quality of calls."
"HIGHS- good sound quality, good reception, and decent battery life LOWS- VERY small cheap feeling plastic buttons, confusing menu, no flash"
I saw this phone at Best Buy for the same price but with $30 included air time
"I bought this off of ""I sell things"". It is the wrong color, scratched and beat up badly! It's not worth the postage to return or exchange it! My daughter worked hard for this and got crap!"
"I was told on the phone, by Amazon customer support, that this phone had Bluetooth capability. The Amazon website even shows you bluetooth headsets as ""available accessories"". However, this phone doe not support either bluetooth or wireless headsets. I guess that is why it is so cheap. I had to return the phone. Inside the packaging, Samsung had a picture of a ""corded"" headset you could purchase for this phone."
we havent got the phone yet but id say my dad will love it cause he has been lookin for one like it
"A friend was using one of these phones, then gave it me about 6 months ago. A few days back, I just switched my sim card and went online to at&t change the ""make"" of my phone, this phone wasn't available in the list. But it works just fine, only been using it for a few days, long battery life. I just use it for the occasional call so I can't comment on the features. I do not know if there is anything else needed to get it working since mine was already used, and I would get another because I have seen some decent prices around."
"Got this phone for temporary use while travelling in the US. Difficult to activate - had to call AT&T when the online activation wouldn't work - took 20 minutes on the phone with a very friendly AT&T associate to activate, mainly because I didn't save the plastic box it came in so didn't have the UPC number! Texting is a nightmare with cheap keys and no Qwerty keyboard. Menus are difficult to follow and aren't logical. I even found it difficult to answer when someone called. Can't wait to get home to my iPhone... BEst just to go to a store and buy one there already activated and ready to go. It's now known in my family as the StopPhone."
"First of all I need to delete my lst review since there was much confusion when I tried to activate this phone with Verizon. This phone does not go by IMEI, it goes by DEC and HEX, the Verizon rep didn't look on Verizon guildelines as I finally did but thought it was an obsolete phone. The problem was Verizon's not the seller. The 2nd Verizon rrep got the phone activated. The seller called me and asked me to remove my negative comment which I am attempting to do. I ended up returning the phone because it wouldn't hold the charge. The seller generously gave me not only my sale price but refunded both postage to and from the seller."
"I made a three hour international call and it didn't even bring the battery meter have a bar. WOW, I am so impressed on the long battery life. The sound quality compares to my Infinity Accoustics Kappa Audiophile studio speakers. No need to raise the volume. I had ordered this flip phone to compliment my Moto Droid Touch IV Mini as a backup phone. I have found my new main phone. $35.00 for this product is a steal. it should be worth more."
"Horrible purchase. Came today and first thing I noticed is it is far from ""like new"". Looks like my 5 yr old has been playing with it a few yrs. Avoid at all costs. I guess its cheap for a reason. Dont waste your money"
"After only having this phone for a month it won't charge. First of all I ordered a pink one for my daughter and it arrived in silver. The charger that was included was clearly not the factory Motorola charger. When I plug in the phone now it displays a message saying that it is unable to charge. I have not tried an alternate charger yet, but I shouldn't have to. The one that came with the phone should work."
"The phone arrived with some scratches on the front and back, and I was a little disappointed when I saw the keypad was weathered and worn more than I'd like, but considering it's an 8+ year old phone, it's in very good condition. The screen, dial pad, speaker, everything works as it should. Had no problem activating it on to my existing verizon account. The included charger works great, however the battery was pretty weak, it only lasts about 10 hours or so on a full charge. Just order a replacement battery to be safe, (they're a few bucks) the phone lasts for days now with the new battery. Good phone though, good seller"
"I have this "" sane phone "" in "" Paris Hilton Red "". The Phone is "" Simply Awesome "" . Has "" All Great Cell Phone Features '. I Love It some much ---------- I'm "" soon going to pruchase this same phone again "" ! Would recommend this order and cell phone to "" Any And All Amazon Cusotmers "" Sinply Becasue It Is A Superior Cell Phone "" !"
"DISAPOINTED! phone was great, but the ""new"" battery wouldn't hold a charge long before dying. This was for my 78 yr old disabled dad and he can't use it. Too much of a hassle spent charging all the time."
Verizon cannot hook up that phone any more. Too old and not powerful enough. Verizon said no more with those phones. You shipped what I asked for so not your fault.
Defiantly much smaller then raiser I remember.
"Bought this phone used (but claimed to be refurbished), and it was supposed to be fully tested and functional. It is not. First, the battery would not hold a charge, so bought a new OEM battery. Plugged it into the supplied (with the phone) charger, and received an error message that the charger was not an authorized Motorola charger. Bought a new charger (now we;'re up to $28.99 for the phone, $6.22 for the OEM battery, and $3.50 for the new charger. The phone refuses to work. Was able to activate it over the internet via computer, but the phone itself has internal problems. It starts, then flickers and dies. Repeated attempts to make it work were useless. Even tried using the phone with the charger still plugged in, and no luck. It lights up, flickers, and then dies, over and over. This phone was not refurbished, nor even tested. It's used, and its internals do not work properly. By the time I got the new battery, and then waited for the new charger and finally was able to use the phone, it was too late to take any action about the phone's failure to even operate in basic mode. I've got what amounts to a $40 paperweight. Be very wary about buying used phones, esp those that claim to be ""refurbished"" and fully functional. You get what you pay for, and in the case of used, or refurbished phones, you're taking a big risk that it'll even work, much less be fully functional. Lesson learned. No more used phones, nor dealing with sellers of these products."
I bought this for my mom. She had a smartphone but didn't like it. She loves this phone and it isn't in to bad of condition. It can be a little glitchy at times and had also turned off for no reason a couple times. The charging port is very loose and that could be reason it randomly turns off. It is a used phone and I dont think I would get another one.
The first phone I got from this company was not unlocked. And a month after I got this phone it has issues with charging.
Lovely memories are in my hand!
the cell phone is broken
Got it in the mail way way late and then I charged it over night. I went to turn it on and it would light up on the front screen but only for a second and then go black. I never could get it to turn on and wasn't able to hook it up to the line I needed it on. Returns take forever and I really needed a phone so I wound up having to just buy another one. Money doesn't grow on trees. When you buy a product that they guarantee is in working condition they should make sure it is.
"Nice phone, suck company."
"This phone was advertised as Used - Mint Condition!!! When I received it, the phone looked like new and I was very excited to put the battery in and let it charge before calling my phone company to make the transfer. Once the back was removed, the phone was clearly a REFURBISHED phone from the manufacturer. Reluctantly, I placed the battery and let it charge for 12 hours until it said charge complete. I turned the phone on and let it sit for 24 hours without using it. The next day, it was totally drained. I repeated the steps again to just be sure and this time, I let the phone charge for 24 hours. Again ,I left the phone and low and behold, it was totally drained. This phone was either damaged, or had a battery problem which I will never know. I will not buy from these people again. I have to now pay for a return shipping and waste more time taking it to UPS and wait for the credit to be issued.....AGGRAVATING....."
Bad battery and other problems
"This phone is great. Does just what it should and I think it is better made than most of the lower end phones a person can buy now days. They seem to be more fragile, lighter weight and cheaply made. This phone takes really nice pictures, too. It isn't iPad quality, but for the price I am very happy."
"These are great phones. My wife's old one had a broken screen, so I replaced this and my son's non RAZR phone. We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I ""upgraded"" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn't want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn't like their current non-smart phones. I'm guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don't use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon's better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn't upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from ""Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)"" to ""Legacy/unsupported phone. Don't waste your time to try again"". If I didn't see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn't see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online ""upgrade/replacement"" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn't think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn't want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don't have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars. Verizon's GetItNow and BackupAssitant support of these legacy Verizon phones, 2 stars."
"Bought this for my parents who were reluctant to try a smartphone when their razr stopped working on their provider. Didn't work. Gave 3 stars because the seller tried to make it right but the second didn't work either. Oh well, I tried."
Good phone! Phone arrived kind of dirty but phone works great!
Worked pretty good. A little laggy though and sometimes it seemed as though I would text too fast for it to keep up. I still enjoyed it though.
"This is an old school Motorola phone, but works well and is reliable. The only thing I am not crazy aout is that the battery doesn't last long. It really needs to be plugged in each night. I bought a newer battery, but it still doesn't last that long."
"Very delayed, asked if it had any noticeable defects knowing it was refurbished/used, but was assured it worked great. Extremely delayed navigating from contacts to messages, and so on. Going to have to buy another phone."
I really like this phone. It has better reception than my last phone. Less dropped calls and clearer voice reception. Like the size and how easily it opens. I am even getting used to the pink color.
excellent product and service.
This phone no longer works.
Verizon cannot activate this phone. It was a waste of money.
"I specifically ordered this particular phone because of the ""little to no scratches"" , not the case here. Screen is scratched inside and out, the phone looks like it was dropped on the corners a dozen times at least, scratches on the back also. This seller needs to be a lot more specific to the condition of the phone. Pictures would be an excellent idea, I didn't turn the phone on yet I hope it works."
"Motorola razr gets a 4 star, basic flip phone, easy to activate. Device can take a memory card for music and photos. That was a nice surprise. Haven't used it yet to give an first hand opinion. Doesn't hold a charge for more than a day. However will re-charge very quickly. Heavy users, better carry a battery pack. People may say wow they still sell those! But if your not into the smartphone phenomenon, this phone will suit you well."
I was not able to activate the phone (the numbers I needed off of the back were missing).Some numbers on the phone did not work. I had to pay for shipping to receive it and to ship it back. I was only refunded the amount I paid for the phone.
"ESN of the phone does not match the Verizon ESN printed on the sticker in the battery compartment. Consequently, Verizon will not activate phone. Wasted $30."
"I have had 3 of these phones, this one will not snc to the bluetooth in my car like m other one did, it is the old programming, and it cannot be up dated--I want to return this for a full credit, lets see how I get jerked aroud now"
my phone would not connect to the network and it was a verison network and screwed around with it for 2 hours. Never doing that again.
it was in bad shape full of scratches itlookedas used as it was no hapoy with it at all.
"The phone arrived just within the time frame for delivery. The outside was in excellent condition and looked almost new. The inside, however, was dirty and had traces of chocolate! The phone performs all of its functions except that the memory card reader does not work. All in all, considering I was looking for a quick replacement for a phone that wasn't working properly, I am happy with the purchase and the price."
"I purchased this rather basic piece of equipment ""used"" assuming that the risk of defect was low. I got burned. The device will not power down completely without pulling the battery. Also, the battery is completely depleted after approx 30 mins of talk. The only reason I didn't returned it is because I had already given it to my elderly mother. Plus, I didn't want to expend more of my valuable returning it. The cost was less than $50."
The charger collapsed on receipt. Don't know if the phone works. At $150 bucks would expect a manual in original packaging. Stuff thrown in a box with nothing else!
"I bought this for my husband because he doesn't like or want a smartphone. He had an older version of this phone, many years old, and it lasted forever until the battery finally gave out. For about $50 more I was able to get him this new one. It is a great little phone, very slim and light, and the camera and standard features work great. Would recommend for someone who just wants a phone for making and receiving calls, simple texts, and a few pictures here and there."
Battery does not work
I find this phone to be one of the finest basic phones available. This is my second one. The original lasted six years with one battery replacement. For the money you will not find a better basic phone.
Works well as a secondary devise.
"this phone is terrible, as soon as i received the phone i realized that it wasnt charging at all...dont buy a used phone from amazon...its terrible. when i plug the chaarger it says complete charge after 1 or 2 min of using the phone it starts saying low battery...i had to talk on the phone while it was pluged on the wall...bad experience hopefully ill get a complete refund.."
Timely arrival. Phone condition was as advertised. Life of battery seems to be OK. Only disappointment in moving it to my Verizon account was that the pictures I had on the phone wouldn't transfer to this one. Contact phone numbers transferred OK.
"Arrived quickly, charged quickly, added to Cell phone account easily and without and hassles. Great product!"
Delivered on time. Better than new.
its nice but I was wondering if this phone takes a sim card
Would Not Turn On.
"Used this as parts, outdated phone so I have nothing to say about it."
Great phones.. Seller was great to deal with.
Works Great!
Well pleased with the secondhand RAZR. Thank you so much.
Didn't work as details specified
"The phone was ok but battery must have been junk would only stay charged for 1 day and after 2 weeks the sound went completely bad, could not hear incoming or out going calls, ended up purchasing a new phone from Verizon, so much for the LIKE NEW advertisement!"
The supplier exceeded my expectations as the quality was even better than advertised and the phone go here quickly.
It would not work at the verizon store. We tried a they said it wouldn't work. Disappointed with this phone
RAZR phone was just as advertised. Used but like-new condition with just a couple of scratches. Shipped promptly as advertised. Having this replacement phone really has saved us from upgrading to a more expensive contract. Verizon staff transferred all the phone numbers with ease at no cost. Thanks Golden Net !
NEVER WORKED FROM DAY ONE.
"This phone has a mind of it's own. The video works when it wants to and the charge may last a day or 15 minutes.New, this phone is the best, but used, you never know what you're going to get. This particular phone is a dud!"
Phone didn’t work and never heard back from seller
"phone was in excellent condition, however the numbers 2 4 6 and 8 did not work. Should have known by the low price it was to good to be true."
Motorola RAZR V3m Arrived in in good shape and on time. It came with a charger but the battery doesn't always hold a charge.
"Everything as expected, no problems. The case came separate from the phone, which was a little weird, but everything was in great condition and the phone works great."
Replacement for my husband's old one just like it! He loves it!
"It doesn't know when it gets closed, all features related to opening and closing don't work. I knew it was used, but not broken."
"It says it's verizon wireless compatible, but it's not. Verizon technical support said they would be unable to activate it. Only works with ""Alltel"" plans."
Didn't even work. Was told differently that it worked. No. I'm getting my while REFUND BACK
I ordered this because my current RAZR V3m was not reliable in receiving a signal. After several days I began having the same problem. At first I thought it was Verizon but obviously it's not. I have absolutely no complaints with the vendor.
Put in the new battery still doesn't hold a charge
Broke within two weeks not a great product used
"Did work, but not correctly. Shut off at will waste of money."
"Phone is fine, it works and looks good. No damage. Its just that the battery didn't hold a decent charge. You'd think they would test the battery on it or leave notes saying battery isn't good."
"This phone doesn't stay charged and when the battery gets low it will not send text without notification the text didn't send. Has cause major headaches!! Sorry I got rid of my other phone, it worked much better than this one."
Exactly as described!
"I had a phone like this before ,and had no problems, this phone even with a new battery with not hold a charge, I would never buy a used cell phone again. It has been plugged into the wall more than used to talk on."
"no one could program it so sent t back, case was a waste. was with out a phone for 10 days."
Fast shipping.Phone was in great shape as described.I just wanted a basic phone and this one is perfect.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a basic phone.
I love this phone! I've purchased many over the years and this is the nicest. Exactly as described.
"I am not a texter so this phone is perfect. Flat, easily fits pockets and all menus are and controls are clearly understandable."
"Phones lasted only a few days each; back light out, difficulty in charging. Waste of money, time & effort. Do not recommend."
Piece of crap. Should have known better. It worked for a while BUT started going crazy. I don't recamend. Nope
The phone arrived very well packaged. I activated the phone and it work perfect. The phone was in such great condition it look like it was new.
the battery just keeps going dead so fast. I think yall sold me a defect battery
Happy with the purchase.
"I don't like that you can't personalize anything on the phone. Not settings, not layout, not directional keys, nada. It's difficult to navigate and doesn't have the wide variety of options for viewing messages by contact vs individual message. You also cannot send or I think receive video messages. Has a decent camera however. Also with a used phone the battery life and the battery itself are crap. Wouldn't make this purchase again but is a good phone to get you day to day if yours is broken/defaulty like my old one was."
"This is a great phone. I got exactly what I wanted. I have used it every day, good stinking phone."
This phone will not be usable without buying a new battery. This was a waste of money. I would not buy a used phone on Amozon again.
Thanks
It did not work.
Good little phone
The battery for this phone keeps dying. Has to be recharged at least twice a day. Time display needs larger font.
Phone is junk. Won't hold a charge. Stays hot when in use.
The charger did not belong to this particular phone
The volume control never worked. Replacement sent and after 1 month white bar across the screen. Was cheap but not worth it all the time wasted and we ended up buying an unused/unopened phone from another seller. Customer service was good but product not.
I like the small thin design as it fits neatly in my shirt pocket and meets all my wireless needs.
This phone looked to be a prepaid phone and it did not get a signal. This phone did not work for me. Was returned.
As advertised
"Good, reliable & exactly what I ordered."
Works great no problems what so ever I love it
"I purchased this phone in hopes of replacing my old razr from Verizon. I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising."
Do not waist your time and money on this product. Phone did not come with a serial number so I cannot use the phone. The sender is not giving me the option to return it either. I'm calling amazon.
"The one works. It smells like cigarettes. I bought it ""like new"". There's a numerous amount of deep scratches. & there's still photos from the orinial user that I cannot delete"
never worked
"Yes, I was very glad to have my ""old"" phone back. ther were a bunch of old calls on it. I called a couple of them (in Ohio) and then deleted them"
"The cell phone worked fine,but when I went to Verizon I could not activate this phone on my plan. I would highly recommend not ordering cell phones from this seller."
"Good at the time I use them, but now they are not needed."
"The phone could not be activated because, after a number of attempts, the sales person at the Verizon store said it was too old. ."
I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PHONE. IT ONLY STAYS CHARGED FOR SO LONG. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
"This item was purchased several months ago and has never worked. I am the mother of the under age child who hit the button to purchase this phone with a credit card she had saved on Amazon. She did not have permission or authority (our fault) to purchase it. When it came and we (parents) found out about it, the battery was dead and would not hold a charge of any kind. To use the phone it had to be plugged in. What's the purpose of having a cell (cordless) phone if you have to leave it plugged in to use? I think the person who sold her this phone knew this and wanted to dump it off on any sucker who nibbled on it."
I want AT&T phone
"First of all, this section is for rating of a MOTO RAZR, NOTHING ELSE. STOP complaining about poor shipping speeds and bad customer service. If you got a bum deal on a used phone, wake up people, you get what you pay for! Now my review: I paid $20 for a USED Moto Razr, and it was a screaming deal! The phone is slim, still styleish after all these years and works PERFECTLY!! Razr has always been a good phone. DON'T BE STUPID and follow the negitive reviews, these are from clueless consumers who really don't know much about electronics. They are rating the shipping time of the phone and that is NOT what these reviews are for. Deal with it. PHONE RATING: 5 STARS. Keep in mind- these are OLD ELECTRONIC DEVICES! Did you really think they would work just like new?! FOOLS!"
"I'll first say what others have said on similar reviews--this is a review of the actual phone, not the seller or the carrier service. What can I say? This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It's not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn't the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I'm rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn't for everyone; it has none of the smartphone ""flair"" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn't lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal."
"My original one still works fine, but the paint has worn off, so it looks old. The two (supposedly) new ones do not ring. My son is lucky, his works fine. So if you want to chance it, get one, if vibrate is good for you. I'm back to using my original one bought a long time ago from Motorola. Great phone if it really is from Motorola and is new. I doubt it."
Why is this a best seller in 2018?
"I wasted the $90 I spent on this phone. The keypad became nonfunctional over about four months. First the green button that makes a call, then certain numbers, then the directional arrows. If you drop the phone even once, on any surface, it won't turn on until you remove and put back the battery, and even then it's finicky. Most of the claimed features do not come w/the phone. You have to have the Motorola syncing software."
"Please be careful if you choose to purchase this phone. I purchased 2, one for my mom, and one for myself..I purchased these because they were advertised as Verizon compatible. When I took them to Verizon to have them activated, they could not activate them...they are only compatible with TMobile, and one other signal. I do not want anyone else getting screwed over."
Didn’t work. Called shipper and had no response. Verizon does not support this phone anymore
Just looking at the price is shocking... These dinky phones were po
"I purchased this RAZR as a replacement for my husband's that is falling apart. We are trying to lower out bills and reduce our wireless costs by going back to our basic phones. I got the phone and all accessories very timely, BUT... I call Verizon to activate the phone and they tell me it is in use. What the he**?!?!?! A huge waste of $80 being we can't even use it. VERY UPSET and DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!! Seriously... how can it be in use if I have the phone in my possession? Anyway... SUCKS and never again!!!!"
"Ordered this phone and thought I was getting a good deal, till it showed up and the phone had no battery. Now I have to go and purchase a battery for it... Be careful who you order from!!"
"It didn't work when received. Took it to the verizon store, THEY could not make it work, sent it back for a refund !!!! I wanted it because of the slim design. I carry my phone in my pocket, wish it HAD worked !!"
It wouldn't charge. A ripoff
Arrived in good shape and works just fine!
I really love this phone always have since Verizon first came out with the Motorola RAZR V3m. Nice and slim fits in my jeans pocket nicely. Great sound loaded with features. GREAT! AAA+++
"Remember when it was a cool feeling to sloooowly peeling off the protective film from the screen and or keypad, yea, it was cool wasn't it, these are that same feeling where you can relive those days, the condition will say ""like new"" when I got it from the doorstep to check it out it literally was brand new condition it had the protective film on the screen to slooooowly remove everything looked prestine, this is a basic phone to make phone calls for those wondering will only work on verizon is their own signal, it truly is all you need"
Phone looked brand new. No problem at Verizon with activation. If you have the correct USB cable for this phone bring it with you. I had to transfer contacts one at a time via bluetooth since that required two cables for them to do and they only had one.
Battery wouldn't hold a charge for even a full day. tried buying replacement batteries from other companies had same problems. If trying to use bluetooth with any of the batteries phone would shut off and not turn back on unless you removed and put the battery back in. Tried to return to the seller: Dealscaly but they refused. Wasted my money.
"My sweetheart had one of these since 2005. Recently, the phone ceased being capable of charging its battery (even a new one). I secretly suspect that she had plugged an unauthorized charger into it, ruining the charger electronics. Her contract with Verizon was well past two years, so she was eligible for a free phone. We looked on Verizon.com and everywhere on the internet, but she could not find a phone like her pink Motorola RAZR phone. My sweetheart wanted a pink RAZR phone just like the one she had. This product filled the bill exactly. It is the spitting image of her old phone and every feature works great. It was thoroughly clean outside and all previous numbers and data had been removed inside. She loves her `new' (reconditioned) phone! My sweetheart is 76."
I bought it for my mother
Definitely was able to use this phone for awhile.
"This phone was in GREAT condition! I appreciate the seller, saling the item they advertised. I received it in a great amount of time. I would advise anyone that want to buy used electronics to use this seller. I am more that satisfied and look for to using them possibly in the future."
Could not use to old
"Still a fun old school phone, still has that click open cache."
"The phone was fine. We had it turned on and contacts switched over. The cover of the battery would not stay on, and the charger that came with the phone did not work. We had an old charger for a RAZR to charge the phone. We are returning it and hoping to get another one. Would have been happier to have just switched out the backing and charger. I had contacted the company had no problem getting responses."
"Purchased used - this review is not about the phone in particular, but in the one received from the seller. Additionally, due to time constraints I did not attempt to take advantage of any guarantees. Purchased for my wife - she was sick of her smartphone and wanted to go back to the past. It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use ""genuine"" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn't have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than. Several factory resets and hours later it was stable again, but only temporarily... Pretty sure we got a lemon. It is now in the trash. Moral of the story is that if you have issues, be sure to get ahold of the seller right away."
I currently own an ALLTEL Motorola V3c. I love that phone and since Verizon disabled it I cannot use it. The V3c is nothing like the V3m. The battery needs to be on the charger at all times. This is the 2nd V3m I have purchased since my original phone was disabled and they are both junk. I will resign to the fact that this phone has NO extras and drains the battery continuously. I wish I could remove that star.
"The phone that I received was rated as being in ""very good"" condition yet the entire Get It Now/Media Store function refused to work. This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you. If you want to use ANY of the phone's extended features (ringtones, music and video downloads or any application such as Navigator, Facebook, Backup Assistant, etc.), check with the seller to make sure the phone they're selling isn't suffering from the missing Get It Now/Media Store catalog problem. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word's spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon's review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in pink). Any similarities between this review and any other review that I have written is due to the fact that the problem that I detail in this review directly affects over 50 different phone models, not just the one I bought. Different products, exact same problem."
"Exactly what I wanted. However, it was advertised as being purple, and arrived silver. OK for me as I like silver. Needed to buy battery as the one in the phone would not hold the charge very long."
I haven't had the phone turned on yet but it arrived on time and in great condition its for my 73 year old mom in law she is so excited about getting a new phone so prayerfully Verizon won't have any trouble turning it and transferring her old service to this phone.
"I often have trouble doing a review - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I am pleased with my experience with this seller. The item was just as described, shipped in a very reasonable time frame and the price was reasonable."
phone is unable to be connected to Verizon!
not happy
I have had 4 of these at a time on my family plan over the years and needed to replace a lost Razr and let me I was not disappointed in getting this Razr. Always reliable and small enough to fit in the smallest pockets!
"Junk ,almost 3 hrs to set up. Only works whenever it wants to. Very overpriced."
"I replaced my older RAZR V3m that I dropped on concrete with this exact duplicate. It's a great little phone if you don't want or need all the bells and whistled. And for the price, a very good deal."
"I can find no other cell phone as durable as the RAZR. SInce I don't need a Smart Phone in my life, the metal case makes this my #1 Choice. I hope the cell systems always provide support so I can keep on using the phone I swear by."
"Ended up in the trash --- had charging problems, took it in to Verizon, and the charger outlet in the phone was broken."
"My dad loves his razor so Mich, o had to find a replacement one when his quit working.. Thank you amazon for still having one!!"
Dead battery basically worthless
"I originally bought this phone 6 or 7 yrs. ago and I loved it. I must have dropped it a gazillion times and it worked great for the first five or so years. I had to pray over it to get it to last the additional year. I really did pray over it. The screen finally gave out and I was no longer able to see anything, although I could still make and receive calls. If I put my SIM card in my other phone I could read my texts. After a month or so of that, I broke down and order this phone from Amazon. It was in good working condition, however, it was a Sprint phone (not mentioned in description by the seller) and I have T-Mobile. Luckily I bought a Samsung Exhibit, while I was waiting for the phone to arrive (I planned to give the Moto to my daughter). The Samsung is great, it was definitely time for me to upgrade, but there are some things that the 'ol Moto does that the fancy new Samsung doesn't. For example, the alarm will still go off on the Moto even when the phone is turned off. I liked that feature, because I like to turn my phone off a night to save battery, but know that my alarm will still wake me up in the morning. So basically, if you need a phone to do just about everything except download apps, this is the phone to get."
Very disappointed to find out from Verizon that this is not a Verizon phone. Feels like I just handed over money for nothing.
"Loved it and had it for a long time until Verizon wouldn't give me good service. I was persuaded to change, otherwise I would've kept it forever."
okay but I had to order a new battery which I did through Amazon and it was brand new and it works great now.
The phone can not work very well. Battery runs out so fast. I need to charge it everyday even I didn't make any calls and receive any calls. My friends always complain a lot of noises. I need to switch to other Verizon phone to be able hear well.
Its a pre paid phone so was unable to activate it through our provider. Wish I would have known :(
GREAT TO TROLL WITH
My dad used the parts from this to make another cell phone work and it works great! Got here very fast too!
"The Razor was clean and it very good condition, works well!"
"I got this to replaced a device I had (lost?) in a hospital. It arrived quickly was easy to reload with my phone book and took care of my needs until I was discharged.... Then I wanted it to link to my vehicle's Kenwood. I mean my previous (older) one did. Would not work, so I stopped at the local Verizon where the associate pulled out his smarter phone and quickly said, ""Your Bluetooth isn't working, no signal"". So that where I am, wish the sellar had fully check it out before selling (well I thought that was implied)!"
I needed a simple but uesful phone. If you don't need a smart phone but one that is waht phones were ment to be this one is good.
"I guess you get what you pay for (t was used, and refurbished). It was a real bargain. However it took about 6 months to break."
I needed to get a basic phone and this one meets my expectation. I would recommend this phone as a good basic phone.
"the * button didnt work, but i paid 31 shipped, so i didnt want to give up that easy when i couldnt call *228 for verizon, but got it working. the seller left a few things out about the phones cosmetic blems, but the phone itself is sweet and for $31 shipped not only do you get what you pay for, its sharp for being a non smart phone. i got sick of replacing expensive phones and saving $30 a month for other things. the reason most this phone has such horrible reviews is due to the few crummy scam artist. take from it what you will."
Great
it was in very good condition for its age.
Excellent
Like brand new
Phone was the talk of the store!
I love my phone. It is a new one. I wish I could download songs. But Verizon stopped that. But I still love it.
This is the second review it is the same as the first one . It worked well for the first two weeks not so well now. The condition of the phone cosmeticly is not desirable. However we are stuck with it and have to live with it. 😡
i love my phone
i love this phone but mostly i love the fact i paid $20. for it. i hate the idea of spending half a paycheck (500) on a device that lets people contact me at all hours of the day. plus i have already dropped it over 6 times and its still good
So far so good.phone came in pristine condition cosmetically.all buttons working perfectly.newly manufactured battery (Chinese made).only down side is very small font size with no adjustments possible.otherwise its a mint old school razr and I love it.after 2weeks the supplied battery stopped taking a charge.the seller gave me a refund.picked up an aftermarket battery and the phone is fine.quick service no questions asked.
Nice basic phone. It is just a little too out dated. Reception is a little poor but if that is the phone you want it was in good condition.
IT DOES NOT KEEP A CHARGE AT ALL.
Classic.
works like it should. The battery was not good but that is a minor issue.
Not the condition it was stated to be in. Barely holds a charge on the battery. Disappointed in this purchase.
thank you
The phone was great and the seller did a good job
Much better than I expected for being used. Bought one mew last year an you couldn't tell the difference between the two.
BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK.
I wish i could customize it a but more-front screen and all that- but its a flip phone and i like it. Battery isnt the best. Especially for a basic phone. I activated it on verizon prepaid plan no trouble at all with the DEC instead of an imei. I thing it was like quality used phones? I do love it so far
Was dirty but worked fine.
"One of the best phones I have owned, this is my THIRD one ever since Motorola came out with it."
thank you for the corrections that you made on my order & for sending the rest of my items very very quickly. i will def recommend your store! thank you again.
We still have these type phones in our family and I'm glad we found one. We keep this one in reserve in case the others bomb out on us in the future. You really can't get these anymore and we don't want the new kind at this time.
"the phone is awesome, amazing, and easy to read. the signal and function is special. i just love this phone, and will order many more products from you."
"I still need to upgrade , but my razr needed replacing. This one saved me a lot of money Thanks"
it came in the mail very quickly but its a mediocre phone i know it was going to be but its all i can afford
😆
😊
This was bought as a new in the box and it was new. They did not disclose that the manual was not in the box. The phone works great
"The V3m is still one of the best non-smart phones available. Long battery life, invisible in a pocket, no issues with call loss. All the bases covered. Whats not to like. Great phone!"
"this being the 2nd phone in the past 2 weeks that we have bought, we were once again let down. It arrived in a timely manner but the battery wouldn't charge AT ALL. The buttons on the side were loose and it was supposed to be a brand new phone. The seller was very apologetic when we contacted him about the phone and we are able to return it for a refund. Maybe we just got a lemon. That would be our luck.."
Actually it doesn't even deserve 1 star. Very disappointed. It will not hold a charge at all..thanks a lot for selling me a piece of crap.🙁
it does the job. a old type model.small phone and small screen.but it does the job.the razor v3m. was a good phone then but your choices are limited to what is a basic phone today
"gets good signal and good sound ez to use , i loved this phone. and now they are making me type more stuff so they will post it and i HATE this !"
"Excellent service, I called them about an issue and they went above and beyond to help solve! Phone works great! Thank you!"
"this was to be a new phone,but i did not get a manual with it,and the phone will not hold a change,very disapointed and will not buy from this seller again"
"I purchased a phone that was ""used, in good condition"". I paid extra for expedited 2 day shipping. After 4 days the phone had not yet shipped. I emailed the contact inquiring when the product would ship but received no response. When the product finally arrived I discovered that the key pad did not work, I could only intermittently key in a command and when I did hit send for *228, to activate it with Verizon, the phone never actually rang but simply hung up. In addition, the screen would freeze up and go between frozen to blank white. Terrible responsiveness, show shipment, defective product. And the most frustrating piece of this was that I selected this seller specifically b/c they had received high marks for ALL of these characteristics in all of the previous reviews other than one 3 of 5 for slow shipment. This is very frustrating!"
Missing center button and no charger.
Does not work!!!
a piece of junk!!!
"Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for ""Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..""). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not. NOTE TO READERS: My purchase and experience was with a Verizon V3m in pink. After numerous hours talking with Verizon's tech support and multiple emails, I was able to determine that the exact same problem was happening to many older Verizon phones (there were more than 50 models by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia and others specifically listed in their forum). I am not affiliated with anyone. NOTE TO AMAZON: The material in this review is completely of my own composition and pertains to a number of Verizon phones. This review was composed first in Word to take advantages of Word's spelling and grammar checker, but was composed solely for use in Amazon's review section to review the specifically mentioned products (in this case the Verizon V3m in silver). Any similarities between this review and any other review that I have written is due to the fact that the problem that I detail in this review directly affects over 50 different phone models, not just the one I bought. Different products, exact same problem."
I bought this phone for my great aunt because it was something simple for her rather than the o ne she had at the time. It charges fast and the battery lasts all day. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a simple easy to use flip phone
"I got sick of the whole smart phone thing -- especially texting. If you can't take time to call someone and all you want to do is text, then you have, in my opinion, poor communication skills, or you're just a millennial, plain and simple. This phone takes you back to the basics. If you want to surf the net, you can. But the main reason I use it is for making calls. They are clear (Verizon service is tops), the phone speaker sounds great, and the buttons are big (I have big hands). Can't beat this purchase if you're looking for a durable, good looking phone."
"It's a Motorola flip cell phone-key word in ""cell phone"" being ""phone' I have a computer for everything else. Previous ""Barrages"" have survived swims in the ""toilet sea', the Gulf of Mexico, the washing machine rumble, etc. However, do not ""flip it open' and simultaneously allow it to flip out of your hand and land on the floor in a ""pike position"", pike facing down..! --unless you want (literally!) a two-piece phone.... great bargain."
"Ordered 2 of their refurbished phones. Both were great. Showed a little wear, but really in great shape. They were as advertised. Service is Excellent! One of the phones had a wall charger that didn't work (didn't receive electrical current). I contacted them through Amazon. They responded immediately - shipped out new charger same day AND said I could throw the other one away. They saved me from having to do anything! No return shipping, etc. That, to me is Outstanding Customer Service! We love the phones! Perfect for people who prefer flip phone. Durable - which is good for my hunter and my 85 yr old mother! Mother likes to text some, but gets real confused with a qwerty keyboard. Texting is smooth and easy with the dial pad on this phone - works really great for her. The feature to announce who's calling helps her because some ring tones don't register with her hearing aid. The voice announce works perfect. Both users are very happy with their phones."
"May have worked great, but Verizon no longer supports it."
Turns out Verizon no longer supports this phone shame
"Excellent quality product... bought it for my husband years ago (who inevitably dropped and consequently broke every other flip phone we've had) and it is STILL IN GREAT CONDITION! Metal hinges are VERY strong and sturdy, and they remain tight (lid does not wiggle at all). All buttons look and work like new, screen is bright and clear. Wouldn't trade this durable little phone for any other type!"
"Motorla flip phone! Make sure you order a new battery the one I got last two hours! I bought an extended battery with cover last for days and days! Great phone great packing fast delivery, but the seller failed to mention the battery is worthless! 🐖 I love this phone! 2 star phone! Wouldbe4 stars but the side buttons all deteriorated what a joke! Military grade I THI NK NOT"
"Had trouble with this model just shutting off, even tried to order new ones, they did the same thing. So this was returned."
"I'm a flip phone junkie. This one is my favorite. Came amazingly fast, wrapped well, everything exactly as advertised. Would purchase again in a heartbeat."
"The phone from day 1 just never charged well, it was say complete and just shut down part way through the day. and now, 9 months later, it wont hold a charge at all. apparently the component inside the phone that is supposed to hold a charge is lose, and what else is terrible is No one wants to refund me so i can get a replacement phone. This is just not fair. . I'm out 60$ and now another 75$ to have to buy a replacement."
"Great purchase. My husband and I (in our mid 20's) have no interest in smart phones or anything like that. We just wanted something simple and durable that can make phone calls. The phone, though used, works just fine. It had a few scratches on it but it works perfectly and hopefully will be disaster resistant for my husband! My husband had a history of getting cellphones wet so that was another reason we picked this one, it was listed as water resistant. We are very happy with this phone."
I've complained about the volume on the ringer on this phone but the seller keeps on closing the case and denying that the phone is defective and wanted to charge me $20 for re-stocking fee if I decide to return it. I took it to Verizon store and have it checked and they admitted themselves that the phone is defective. What's the use of using a phone if you cannot hear it ring so it's just sitting here still in the original package and waiting for a solution and probably some use for it. I'm very disappointed with this purchase and I hope Amazon. com will do something about this situation.
"Excellent old school Star Trek communicator-style flip phone. Gets much better reception than iPhone and won't break if you drop it on the ground, in the toilet, out of the window, out of your shirt pocket onto the toilet then onto the ground, or if your dog or toddler chew on it. Beam me up, you drunk, fat, Captain Kangaroo clone."
"The rubber parts are now ""shedding""."
"I had one touch screen phone in my life. The touch screen broke and without buttons, I couldn't even make phone calls. So I bought this tough and easy to use phone. It's perfect for my back pocket. I don't use apps or even text that much. The camera works well enough for me and I never butt dial anyone! I'm not even embarrassed that I don't have a smart phone....frankly, I don't care what people think."
"This was a bargain! I would definitely use the seller again. I had some questions on the item and promptly received a response. Got this for my son, who really likes it, especially that it has a camera and can take a beating when going camping. The phone was received in very good condition, charged too! The transaction was easy and the item received quicker than expected in proper packaging. I especially liked that I didn't have to go with a contract."
"Very durable phone and has some nice features for a flip phone, which by the way is getting almost impossible to fine, especially one of the quality of this phone. My only complaint is how thick it is, and to make matters worse I got the extended battery and back which makes it even thicker, but is nice for how much longer it lasts. Guess the old adage is true........ you can's get 10 lbs of s*** in a 5lb box......;)"
"I like these phones. They are ruggedly built, and they are Water resistant in up to 3 feet for up to 30 minutes. I bought these to replace similar Motorola phones that lasted 5 - 6 years. That being said... Please read this very carefully... These phones are NOT ""NEW"". They are REFURBISHED. After being fully charged, they would lose 25% of that charge in less than 10 - 12 hours, even when hardly used. As these are refurbished, the manufacturer will NOT give you the usual 1-year warranty. Typically only a 30-day warranty. I sent them back to the seller, and bought new phones nearby."
I could not use it.... it was to old
We received the phone only to discover the charger did not fit into phone. We had to immediately buy a new charger at Verizon. The following day the rubber lid placed on side of phone fell off. After searching for it for hours in vain.... we placed a strip of electricians tape over one inch opening. It is an opening showing intricate metal parts that should be protected from debris. On a final note we are not going to buy a used phone ever again.
"Bought this for my dad as a birthday present. My dad isn't up to the times with cell phones, he doesn't even text lol. But he needed a good sturdy phone for the basics, making calls and some picture taking. He loves it and loves the battery life on it."
"Was not ""new"" as advertised. Had been previously registered to a different phone #. Recharge port cover does not stay closed when not in use so it is not water tight. Can not change personal settings do to old password still being in it. Had to stop texting feature since it does not allow deleting of texts and when delete text is pushed phone shuts off. Still best ""rugged"" phone you can get but it would have been nice to actually have bought a ""new "" phone as advertised."
"After 3 weeks of use , three of the button covers have fallen out and lost. Now I have to use a pen to push the buttons in order to control these 3 functions. How long is the warranty on these phones, I would like to have this one replaced."
2ND PHONE EXACTLY LIKE THIS. PURCHASED BECAUSE OF TOUGH QUALITIES. 1ST ONE LOST SCREEN COMPLETELY AND COULDN'T REPAIR BUT COULD FIND NOTHING BETTER TO SUIT NEEDS. A GREAT PHONE WITH GREAT RECEPTION. STILL ONE OF THOSE WHO JUST NEED A GOOD PHONE THAT'S TOUGH. PROBABLY WON'T MAKE MUCH LONGER BUT FORTUNATE TO FIND THIS NEW ONE A GOOD DEAL AND GREAT PURCHASING EXP WITH VENDOR
"I don't have big expectations for a cell phone. I ask only that it make and receive calls, stand up to a decent amount of rough handling, and not crap out when I get a little sweaty (talking while exercising). Yeah, it sounds silly, but I've had several that died from that small amount of moisture. The Barrage has been good to me so far (about 40 days). It's my first phone with a data package and, if that were important to me, I'd go for a larger screen. This one is big enough, though, to handle an occasional look at my e-mail or a quick browse here or there. As a ""free"" phone (for 2-year contract commitment) I'd say I'm quite happy with it. Someday I may spring the big bucks for a droid or some such (my wife loves her droid-x), but for now this is just fine."
Absolutely pos ...had it not even week first day got it button came off second week another and today lost most and said good shape bs..then won't give me my money back sorry but it's such a POS I can't even send it back
Totally useless
"I got a lot more phone than I thought I would with this. The camera is better than any I have had before, and it shoots video, too. I just needed something inexpensive to get me through to my next upgrade when my old phone died, and this was perfect. I also got it in less time than amazon said I would, which was great."
"It was alright. It ended up in the washing machine ,accidentally . I must say , Ten days to ship it was ridiculous not to offer any other shipping options!!! but in all fairness the phone was different then what I was used to . My G'Z Rock- went through the same washing machine and I can still make and receive calls , with no screen display . Thank you for checking up on me and my purchase . I don't find that level of concern every day!!! Have a great day and I look forward to doing more business with you."
"You can have all of the little computers they call smart phones. I cannot read anything written on it. If I want a camera, I'll use a camera. I just wanted a phone. This one works well. Before long the 'smart phones' will also be vibrators and the airheads won't be able to decide which end to apply them to."
"I bought this phone for my husband and after a few months started having issues , static, bad connection, dropping calls, it's not worth the money. I regretted buying it it, I do not recommend it."
"Second one of these I have owned. With my line of work (farming), I am really tough on a phone. Previous Barrage lasted 5 years through all the abuse. Glad I found another, because simple function, Mil-Spec, phones are hard to find."
Phone died after 3 months of light use. If it were possible to leave a 0 star review; I would We owned this phone(purchased directly from Verizon) and loved it so ordered another. This phone has to be a fake. The rubber covers for the buttons on the side started falling off after a month and the whole phone died a week ago. The company refused to replace or allow a return.
Worked good for me
I am so glad to have my 'new' to me phone. It is so nice to not worry so much I am going to break it when I drop it not. Still insure of a few things but I am learning.
"I have alot of experience with the motorola barrage, and ordered this one to replace my old barrage that finally quit after three years of use. I love the product and hate verizon quit carrying it in thier stores. As for this phone, I am impressed with the speed that it was delivered, and it being used was quite impressed with its condition, it looked almost unused. I'm very much satisfied with my order and would highly reccomend this to another person"
purchased phone and after 2 months started having problems with it! have had numerous barrage phones before and never had this problem!!!!!! Purchased two and the second one will not activate!!!!! problem is that it was a couple of months before I activated phone so no longer able to return!!!!!!!!!!
I have one of these phones already so I knew what to expect but did not know what shape it would be in since it was used and reconditioned. It looked almost new and functioned like new.Very happy with the phone and price.
"the camera does not work ,,,the battery does not hold a charge....if i had know it was from the dealer dealscay. i would NEVER have bought it,,,this is the second phone i have gotten ripped off from this dealer"
MY HUSBAND IS SATISFIED WITH THE WIRELESS PHONE THAT HE CAN NOW ACTUALLY HEAR PEOPLE WHEN THEY TALK TO HIM. WE DID NOT RECEIVE THE UPGRADE ON SAME DAY SHIPPING AT NO COST. IT TOOK ABOUT A WEEK TO RECEIVE.
"2nd time ordering and owning, using this phone, was that dependable. Highly recommend for non smart phone folks. Arrived in great time, shape, set up easy."
