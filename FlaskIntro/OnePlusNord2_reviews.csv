"As a diehard Samsung fan who has had every Samsung phone since before the S series started, this has been my favorite upgrade so far. I am amazed at some of the reviews and think people may just have a defective device that needs to be replaced. The battery life is amazing."
Love the phone. the phone is sleek and smooth and beautiful I highly recommend the phone you will not regret getting this phone.
Adequate feel. Nice heft. Processor's still sluggish for the few apps that I have installed. Samsung wants to vacuum all of your data with their apps that requires more access than needed. What else is new.
"Never disappointed. One of the reasons I've been a long Samsung (product) consumer, they're ability to impress me with each product release. I've owned, or maintained, all Samsung smartphones starting with the S4 and the S8 is the best one yet."
I've now found that i'm in a group of people that have carried their phone in their pocket without problems until the S8. Day one screen has crack from being in my pocket. Bluetooth on my 1st trip struggles to stay connected. Good news.....battery life is great and lots of great features.
"I am the type of person who never would completely be sold on a phone I really was not into Samsung until the S7 (Before that I had a Galaxy Nexus, but that was a Google phone). I got the S7 because at the time the fries made the most sense for me."
"The way this Samsung S8 phone operates is more cumbersome than my previous phone, HTC M9. When making a call you must select phone and then select the dial pad. It should automatically go to the dial pad."
I bought this phone very excited to use it. I agree with all the other reviews stating that trying to use a glass screen protector with it is a nightmare. I have so far has 2 different screen protectors on it and both times they have made it difficult for me to tap on the screen.
"It is an extremely advanced and truly a Smart phone. Great apps, great look. BUT, the durability is that of a fresh egg. Don't consider this phone without insurance. The screen is fragile and one crack voids warranty. Won't buy another Samsung based on their lack of support for a poor design."
"Great phone with a PHENOMENAL Camera, not all that hard to get use to. However the screen IS NOT 5.8,"" it's not all that bigger than my S7 Edge. So maybe a 5.6"" screen, it just looks bigger cus it's not as wide as my S7 Edge, takes amazing pictures."
"I initially wasn't 100% certain about this handset, coming from the Nexus line I am very much used to a stock Android OS, I was worried about bloatware and various other things Samsung would add."
"this arrived a week before it's release date, very happy with it. Features are good, light weight and great screen resolution."
I traded in my galaxy s6 for this one and I don't regret it. The battery is long lasting despite all the mindless scrolling I do on instagram and facebook. The images and photos look outstanding.
"I have always been a Samsung fan, especially with their phones. Unfortunately, the S8, in my opinion, is no flagship phone. The S7 Edge is still the winner in my book. Here is why I feel the way I do. The tactile button on the home screen is cumbersome, as is the Bixby button on the side."
Took the risk and bought this phone and I must say it is impressive in every aspect. I was skeptical at first cause I've spend the last 3 years with Apple hardware and software being the latter my primary concern coming in.
I moved from the S7 Edge and love this phone. I think the cons regarding the fingerprint scanner are wrong. I've had very little problem with the combination of the fingerprint and IRIS scanner. They work fine most of the time.
"I love the phone but there are some glitches. When I go to put in my pattern to unlock the phone, it unlocks before I'm done. I keep getting a pop up that says DQA stopped working (whatever that is). Few other things but over all it's a great phone."
This phone makes everything so easy to learn.
This is my third Galaxy S phone. It is amazing.
"Battery life is great, but it would be better without the curved edge."
The S8 is a more elegant than the iPhone. It does more. It allows me to set up the phone as I want it. I love it. I have been an Apple user for 22 years. It is possible to leave the mothership. I'm proof of that. Goodbye Apple.
Love the camera.. Love the phone
Phone is graet. Love it. U should get on too.
"The Iphone 7+ is a good phone but the S8 is truly amazing. . . can't believe I'm saying that about a galaxy. Fast, snappy and the camera blows 7+ out of the water. Battery life is finally able to keep up a full 12 hours of hard use."
Move from iphone 6s to this s8.. amazing screen and futures... iphone is rubbish compare to samsung s8...
"BUYER BEWARE: My wife and I both upgraded to the s8, we were big galaxy people. We loved the new phones until this weekend when both phones ended up with huge cracks, and seriously we have not dropped the phones at all. I went through the s5, 6, and 7 withhout cases and never had an issue."
"I was so excited to upgrade from the galaxy s6 but was quickly disappointed. I have a 2 month old son so a good camera is super important to me. And since the galaxy s6's camera was amazing I didn't expect newest galaxy to disappoint, I was actually expecting a far better camera."
This phone is admittedly breathtaking however it cannot survive even the simplest of mishaps. Both a close friend of mine and myself have broken ours within the first two weeks of receiving them. Mine feel from less than 2 feet and shattered the ENTIRE screen.
Simply the best phone by far. Loving it :)
I do not like this phone. I had it in my pocket with something else and the screen protector cracked. Replaced it and it has another crack in it. They need to do something different
I love my new phone it really have lot great new features!!
"Great phone. Very easy to manage. I do miss a few features that were on my old phone, but nothing I can't adjust too."
"Its good, but there are some things to not like. The Bixby button is in the way and Bixby doesn't work anyway. The finger print scanner is in an awkward location and so far I find the face recognition to be less than effective. What light you are in seems to make a big difference."
Phone is great! It works just as I expected.
"I have been truly impressed with the new Samsung Galaxy S8. It feels great in my hand. It very easy to read from It is incredibly responsive both to the touch and in changing sites. And, of course, the screen and picture on it are outstanding. I an a Samsung guy. This just helps me to stay one."
I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks. So still getting used to the new features. Don't know for sure if I like or use the edge screen or folders. Still a lot of preloaded apps that I'll never use and can't take off. Disappointed I can't get a screen cover that will work with a case.
Data issues immediately. Tech dept. Is going to get back to me.
If you are looking up this phone for reviews then you already have heard that it is a pretty good phone. I bought the S8 after a lot of research and anticipation but I was still blown away by everything that the phone offers.
"Nice phone. Was worried about all the glass but not a problem. Love the fingerprint reader, works great."
Nice phone but wireless charger does not work
"I'm. Still getting used to it. I had an S6 so there are changes. This GPS is working better. What I Don't like so far are the battery overheating shut downs. As soon as it gets a bit warm, I can't use the camera."
"Love the phone, EXCEPT, no infrared to use tv remote apps. That sucks, and now I have to carry my 5S as well."
Not since the HTC M1 have I been this impressed with with a new flagship phone. I love everything about this device.
No regrets about this phone
"Finely Samsung has hit it out of the park with this new S8, Simply outstanding not buggy i'm believeable pictures"
I haven't found anything negative about it yet. The camera takes beautiful clear pictures. It has plenty of memory. I just lover it.
"We all know what's great about the phone by now and it is fantastic. There is only one thing I have found thus far that annoys me, the bixby button. I hit it all the time on accident and it lights up the phone even when locked. I'm hoping this will be fixed."
Had the Galaxy S5 and thought it was time to uograde. The S8 has a larger screen and takes good pictures but honestly I think the S5 is every bit as good and in fact I like its size better. In my personal opinion I wish I had stayed with the S5 instead of dishing out the money for a new phone.
Needed to get used to it but I really like it
Best cell phone I ever owned.
"The curved edge makes it a little difficult to tap anything that might be on that edge. The other big issue with this phone so far, is that the Gadget Guard protective cover that AT&T sells for it will not stay on and can be broken with literally NO effort."
Love it!! Battery could last longer but phone is great!!!
I bought the Samsung s8 a few days after it came on market and so far I am very very happy. The phone is easy to use and is as described. I recently bought a wireless charger too and am having no issues with the wireless charging (so far).
"This phone is great. If you can get one, do. Camera is awesome, functions are easy. Waaaaaay better than Apple. Also Very have ways to allow you to pay for the phone over time and/or their but now and pay later scheme. Thoroughly recommend."
Bought the S4 because it was revolutionary. Now I've bought the S8 for the same reason. Absolutely amazing phone. Can't get my hands of it.
Arrived next day can't be more happier with the phone and with the service and I had prom code for extra £50 discount it :) I'll stay with you very for ever
"The S8 is a great phone, I cannot fault it at all. This is my first Android phone and it's really easy to use."
"Had this phone for a short time now, what an excellent piece of kit, love it, really smart and looks great."
I bought this last week and so far I am very pleased with the phone
Bye bye iphone hello Samsung galaxy s8. Samsung miles ahead for iphone
"I ordered the phone a week ago and only expected to receive it a week later. I was pleasantly surprised when it turned up 2 days later. It is a beautiful slimline phone, have great features, takes amazing photos and you do not need to download instagram as the phone have built in filters."
"Crystal clear screen, absolutely rapid speed with no lag, and some great features. Plus, as it is slimmer, it fits in your pocket much easier than other mobiles. Simply the best mobile I've ever owned!"
Bought this a week ago and it has exceeded my expectations.its so light but does everything.though my S7 was great but this S8 is fantastic
I recently purchased my galaxy s8 and couldn't be happier brilliant mobile why anyone would chose an I phone instead of this stunning device is beyond me.
This is by far the best phone I have ever purchased and the best samsung pnone so far
This has got to be the best phone around just now. The screen without a doubt is so beautiful. Even though it is a big 5.8 inch screen it only has a similar footprint as my P9. You will not be disappointed with this device.
This phone is amazing screen isnt as big as the s7 edge so id buy the plus version if it was me but overall faultless
"went from S5 to LG G5 thought it was ok but not as many features , then bought this and Wow"""" so much more you can do with Samsung"
I bought it and i like the product its good fone nice features
"Phone is Amazing , no buttons beside the ones on the sides it's a beautiful phone , worth the preordering and money ."
"Love my galaxy 8. It does have problems downloading media pictures however, I'm hoping it's a software issue."
I must say I have no complaints about this phone.
Easy to use with a larger screen.
Very excellent phone with good battery life that doesn't get hot. Very good battery life also.
Is good. Me like Me think you like too
"Pros: - Great Features - ""Ok Google"" is a great feature when i drive and need to message someone , or google a phone number. - Great quality  Cons - It takes literally forever to Charge, I've done some research and I'm not the only one."
Everything about this phone is awesome.
"Constantly getting the ""DQA has stopped working"" message. Im unable to get rid of it. I've tried the recommendations, except the one we need tro purchase to get rid of the message. We shouldn't have to pay fix this issue. Otherwise, love the phone, the videos and pictures, excellent"
Nice camera and screen quality. Battery has great life. Happy 100%.
Only a baby or capuchin monkey could type o this phone c u need tiny fingers. It's located to use and for the most I should be able o take pictures and not have so many spelling errors.
The phone is great but the screen is very sensitive. You butt dial a lot. Make sure you get a glass screen protector
"This upgrade from my old HTC One M8 has been awesome, everything from the camera to the design and color, and it's fast in everything I do, even the charging speed is amazing! Couldn't be happier."
"Overall a great phone. The camera has all kind of new and good features and takes more true pictures especially sunsets. However, the lower mega pixels does not allow as much zooming as before which is disappointing."
Love it best phone I ever had.
A very nice phone. Has many new gadgets
So far phone is working great had minor problems with a Wi-Fi update but got it done
Love the Samsung Galaxy 8!
"Camera is nice, infinity screen is nice. I'm a Samsung fan, so it's great!!"
I had a Nexus 6 for two years and loved it. Only got the S8 because the Nexus was slowing down. I am blown away by the S8. Highly recommended!
"The S8 is a huge upgrade from my S4, I love it The battery life lasted a long time. I can play my Spotify all day at work and still have a 70% charge at the end of the day."
Galaxy s 6 is better want galaxy back
"I, am a nerd. I am a phone nerd. I am THE phone nerd. I've owned every iPhone and Android made (seriously, had 7 android just last year), and this phone is the best ever. Highly recommended"
"Beautiful phone, love the big screen. The iris scanner works great."
I have been buying galaxy phones since the Vibrant. This is the best one yet. No complaints here
"This phone is really amazing.Nice specs,fast and CAMERA is very clear"
"The Samsung Galaxy S8 exceeded expectations in looks, operation and functionally. It replaced a two year old Galaxy S6. Set-up was easy and the software interface was much improved. Port over of settings and files from old phone was fast and easy."
"This is the best Galaxy everything !!! Smart,confortable and precisioner technology. Forever...the best !!!!"
Great phone! I love the upgrades and the infinity screen.
the s8 is killer! upgraded from the S6
The rounded edges make it very important that you find the right screen protector. Even with that - it lifted up with the case for a few days. Fingertip sensor on the back is the worst change. Right next to the camera and it's not a natural way to hold your hand.
"The Galaxy S8 is very fast and a very pretty phone. I like how thin it is compared to my old 6S plus. I am not fond of the fingerprint being on the back of the phone, it's just awkward. I think all in all it will be an upgrade over my iPhone."
"Love my new GS8. Great phone with nice features. Love the camera and the apps. Charges quickly. Battery does go down fast depending on usage. Otherwise, I think this is a great phone."
GREAT PHONE n I will recommended to I know
The phone is very light comparing to the phones i had before. Watching a video on SAMSUNG GALAXY S8 in a dark room is just a breath taking moment because the image resolution is just TOO GOOD to be true. its crystal clear and really high DEF!!
"The phone looks great, works good..but it doesn't have basic functionality good."
Clunky is the best word for it. The new features are a joke. The Interface is slow and annoying constantly needing to hit a button 2 or three times. And the curved edges effect typing. Extremely regret getting the s8
Pre ordered and received early. Amazing phone features and quality camera.
I was amazed by the Samsung Galaxy S8+ it is definitely the fastest Galaxy yet. If you are thinking about switching to this phone... DO IT! You will not be disappointed! 10/10. Samsung knocked this out of the park!!
"I was iPhone user for ten years and I never had any connection problem, wifi or making a call, I just switched to Samsung and wifi is disconnecting so many times consuming my data. I tried everything I found on forums but no solution yet. :("
Awesome phone HATE I BIXBY and there should be some kind of touch config have to type real hard
"Love the phone so far, longer battery life. Camera has always taken great photos."
"Samsung Galaxy S8 appears to be all that was promised. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market looking to upgrade. My husband purchased the S8+ which is also a great phone but it if he could do it again he would not get the S8+ phone which is just a little too large, the size of the S8 is much..."
Was so glad to get a new phone. This phone does just what I need.
"Pros: infinity display, display takes up most of screen, outstanding performance, no lag, dual Bluetooth connection with bt 5.0, dual quad core processors, camera way better than iPhone 7, more real tone pictures, fingerprint unlock without pushing home button first, etc..."
Constantly errors and screen protectors are horrible.
Fragile glass. Had it for a day before the glass shattered after the phone slipped off the couch WITH a solid case on. Samsung would not cover.
"The first thing I want to talk about is screen: it's big, it's high resolution, it's bright. Its aspect ratio is stretched out, so wide-screen content fits it better. The extra visual real estate is nice but using it one-handed is not very easy. The second thing is the design."
"First off, this phone works on t-mobile (kinda). I can't update software as it keeps giving me an error ""sorry we are having trouble authenticating your device"". Since it is a verizon unlocked phone I get an annoying notification that I am not using a Verizon Sim card."
"This phone is great, I was worried about the curved screen because I've never had one before, but it is actually wonderful. The camera is great. The battery lasts for hours! I actually do not mind not having buttons at the bottom of the screen, the screen detects when you press where they would be..."
"This Samsung Galaxy S8 is the greatest piece of technology I own to this day, and I do have serveral lol. But from the design of the phone, the performance, and all around ease of use all while being simplistic yet sophisticated, IT IS FANTASTIC."
"Easy to use, love the design. I think the size is perfect. I like the fact that the home button is part of the screen."
so far so good quick charge is good nice look and feel
"My S - 4 was just about as good as this phone , this thing locks up all the time , my S - 4 never locked up on me . If I was to do it over , the S - 8 would definitely not be in the top 3 or 5 phones to spend so much money on , don't really know what would be at this time !"
I like it so far. It froze up one time I hope it doesn't happen again.
I went from the S5 to this. I love everything about this phone.
"I have only been using a couple of weeks, so still feeling my way around. I am concerned that I have not yet found the protective accessories I want. Right now I have my silver phone in a black case (back and edges) with only a sheet of film protecting the front screen."
Awesome display. Takes great photos. New to Samsung user format so took some getting use to but no problems as of yet with solfware
"No phone on earth comes close, best, best, best,... Apple should keep on inventing red phones why Samsung keeps giving us the future.___________________________________________​​__________________________________"
"Easy to use, quick and nice feel."
"This replaced my S6 which I like alot. This is a far better phone, love the size and shape. The edges for my favorites is a great feature - use it all the time. Easy to set up and easy to use. The finger print scanner is in the back is a little awkward but getting used to it."
Love this phone it is so easy to use it
This phone is awesome! I love the feel of it and the use. It is so simple. No complications. Set up was very easy. We bought two!
Recommend consideration be given to \upgrading your instrument to Galaxy 8; striving to cope with the many features and speed!
"I like pretty much everything about this phone. It's stylish, it's fast, it's and Android. I really like it... but about once a day, it just decides to freeze up. Only a hard-reset will restore function. Then I need to wait 4-5 minutes before it's ready to turn on again."
Did the upgrade from s5 to s8 and so far it's been doing good. Try it you'll like it. Good job Samsung.
"The phone overall is great... however.. I have never been, and I will hate it the whole time I have this phone, a fan of the edged screen.. I hate it with a passion.. It makes the phone junky, and makes it easier to crack the screen. Which makes me think it was done on purpose!"
It serves it purposes the HD is out of this world internets speed is great Great Job att.
"Large screen to phone ratio with beautiful and bright colors. Very fast, Amazing camera, lots of customization options. Battery life is good. Speaker is good."
"the samsung galaxy s8 is an awesome phone, very fast very responsive . The only negative thing I could say is that I don't like the location of the speaker, but that's the only bad thing I could ever say about this incredible device!!"
Nice crisp display. No bezel is good idea. Rounded edge feels and looks nice.
"i love it! the look, festuresand especially the camera"
phone fits comfortably in hand and OMG the improvements are out of this world
"My son loves his new phone, hopefully the quality of this phone last longer than the Iphone"
"I know people rave about the display, it IS incredible. The phone has plenty of RAM and the storage capacity is good at 64 GB. Being able to add a micro SD card of up to 256 GB is incredible, I opted for 128 GB."
I'm 'on the fence about how I feel about this phone. I'm a creature of habit and therefore When I try to use a feature that I became reliant on with my S5 I am unsure how to access it. (very frustrating for me and leads me to question my choice to upgrade ).
"I recently upgraded from the S5 to the S8 because my S5 no longer held a charge for more than 6 hours. I am not a ""phone"" guy who has to have the latest and greatest, but I do use it for business communications and need a reliable device."
This phone is amazing. I just got it and I am loving it.
"I love the Galaxy S8 but I've only had the phone for 10 days and the charging is already messed up. Any time I plug in the charger its saying incomplete connection. Instead of a nice 1-2 hour charge time, I'm now looking at 4-5 hour charge time."
"I received my Galaxy S8 in the mail and I immediately fell in love with my phone, it was a bit big but I got used to it and it's been 9 days since. I got the case which is fine, but not happy with the screen protector, it makes it hard to tap, I find myself tapping several times before I can get to..."
Like screen pixels and color ratios Hate bixby and samsungs launcher and dont care for the edge screen first edge screen dont like it Miss my sony xperia
"Great overall phone! Battery is sufficient, it's fast, beautiful, has a nice camera. I'd don't care so much for all of Samsung's apps, but most of them are easy to uninstall or disable."
"Best phone I have used ever. Previously, I have owned: Apple iPhones 1 through 6s. Android: Nexus 6P, Samsung S6 edge, S7 Edge. The S8 is not only a thing of beauty, the functionality from the touch wiz refinements and feature set over the years have culminated into an amazing experience of..."
"Had the phone for less than 2 weeks and so far, so good. It is a very good looking phone and it's a good size. The performance is there but battery life is more important to me. On medium performance settings, which is ample, to save battery, the battery gives me 2 days with moderate use."
I bought this on pre order. Despatched quickly and efficiently received phone one week before general release. Fantastic choice of phone
awesome phone! easy to hold and takes great photos!
"This phone is simply the best consumer indispensable tech item anywhere! For a phone to be this delicious to hold and use - I don't think it's been done since Willy Wonka! A case is a must to keep it looking nice. Screen - outstanding, beautiful to look at, smooth to the touch."
I purchased the new Samsung S8 and I love its design and features but the phone has already frozen on me a couple of times and now the text message LED indicator light doesn't work. Verizon techs have tried to fix the issue but within a few hours it goes back to not working again.
I am not incredibly impressed with this phone. I switched from a Motorola Razr Maxx. This phone is heavier & narrower - which makes clicking buttons at the top/bottom of the screen difficult (you have to stretch your fingers).
It has a lot of storage including the external microchip.. not sure why Samsung has changed the charging cable.. yea higher speed of charge but was really nice to have a single cable for various products.
"I really like this phone. It is easy to use, and the transition from my Motorola Droid was relatively easy. I used Verizon's app to port stuff over, as the pre-installed Samsung app would not work properly.  So far, battery life is good, over 24 hours and still at around 30%."
I love the tall screen that takes up the most of the display and curves beautifully over the edges. Beautiful watching videos and movies. Great display. The only negative on the phone is the speaker which gives just above average sound but the earphones included are really good.
"I have set up both face recognition and iris scanner security features on the s8. Really easy to use, Screen is awesome and the battery life is much better than my previous samsung s6"
samsung galaxy is the best product the have been produced
The GS8 is incredible in terms of the design aesthetics. The infinity screen and lack of a home button are innovative and will no doubt be copied by others.
"Was very easy to set up, some of the new features are a little difficult to find until you get used to the phone and menu layout. Still, a great phone with almost no issues. Somewhat disappointed with battery life out of the box."
"No Regrets. Superb Quality Feel. Looks great in your hand and much easier to hold than my last Samsung S5. A big step up in looks and features from the S5. Was worried i might not like the edge on the Screen but it adds the the quality feel, and the screen feels great to use."
I have seen a lot of reviews slating the new galaxy and some ofits features but i have had no issues so far.  I previously had a Samsung s6 edge and you see the clear difference between the models and there performance.
"I bought it about a month ago and delivery was even faster than the expected delivery day. The phone is just amazing, it's a next level smartphone. Really recommend to everyone!"
"I ordered early the new Galaxy S8 and I received it earlier than anyone,Very was prompt on delivering it early, the phone is great."
As an apple guy I can say I am converted now :p great phone great futures and you can customise as you want
"I've sold my Samsung S7 Edge and bought S8. The screen is a dream, it's fast and fits perfectly in a hand. Simply, the best phone on a market today! Highly recommended buy."
"I purchased this phone and am so delight that I did it is amazing and looks so smart , it also feels good to hold I've had many admiring comments"
I'm so glad that I got this phone it's easy to use & so quicker than my S6
Such a good looking phone. Excellent. Love it!!!!!
I've had this magnificent phone for just over a week and I am loving every moment. Awesome phone ...
"Great features on new Android OS, an absolutely stunning design and lightning quick makes this the best handset I have ever used. 2 very important features for me were the ease of setting up from my previous phone (You get a wire to connect your old phone to this one and the new software transfers..."
"I see ordered this it's an awesome phone, fast, good quality camera and it just looks really sleek and stylish The only problem is that uneccessary Bixby button on the side as you can easily open Bixby by sliding from the edge."
Excellent phone. The camera is unreal takes beautiful pictures. The screen is so clear to look at can it get and better than this? Hard to see how it could. Ordered this phone few days later and didn't think I would get it before the 28th of April but it arrived on the 20th.
Very impressed with delivery as it come 8 days early on release date. Lovely phone only had it a week though.
Absolutely love my new phone. Its got so many great new features and I like that it takes SD cards for extra storage again.
What a great phone. The picture quality is something else! Love It!
Very happy that I got I early so thank you very much
"so far i am satisfied with my samsung s8, it is completely different from the s6 and s7 it is just gonna take some getting use to"
"#1) The problem with ""The Edge"" is that physics kinda demands a little friction. You can't touch the front 'cause that's where all the buttons are, but now you can't touch the edge either? How do you hold it without Something going off?"
"too many glitches,nothing right works not happy,camara was fun,battery went fast not easy to work with,finger is not working,Bixby not working,what next"
Great delivery phone is fully loaded with features decent camera screen has to be seen blows iPhone out of the water
"Even though I have had it for 3 days, the phone is amazing. The screen is superb. Very easy to transfer from other phone. An added bonus is the extra memory space available."
"First, if you get a screen protector, good luck! The screen protector Verizon put on my phone made it virtually impossible for the touch screen to work without pushing extremely hard. It was way too much effort to reply to email or text. It also caused some problems with the functionality of icons."
It a nice phone but screen is noticeably smaller than my s7 edge. Not much has changed with s8. I just think that I should have waited til next one...not the biggest fan. :(
"The design of this product is awesome, performance is great."
"Amazing phone and amazing service from Very. Pre-ordered on Sunday 23rd April, expected delivery on 28th April. Phone arrived on 25th April. A very happy customer."
"I have no complaints on the phone, I've had it for five days now and am blown away by the screen quality, performance, etc.  The screen protector though...that is a different story. They will try to sell you a tempered glass screen protector, don't get it."
My Samsung S8 phone is wonderful.  Battery life is better than expected. It has preset power management controls/choices that allows you to reduce power consumption (which includes reducing some functionality) but keeps one 'on-the-air'.  There are numerous customizations to personalize the phone.
Couple little issues out of the box but nothing to give a bad review about because they will get fixed. Fast and silky smooth. Battery last all day. Came from a droid turbo
Didn't think the infinity screen would amount to anything but it's fantastic. It truly makes a difference. The first 24 hours had a steep learing curve but it quickly made sense and was fun to use the new stuff. I came from the S6 and tthe difference is profound. You should make the switch!
"This phone has definitely lived up to the hype so far. Amazing display, lightning fast and fits in my front pocket so much better than my Note 5. The facial recognition to sign in works great! I really like Google Assistant so I don't really care about Bixby. Not sure yet about the battery."
They have done it again with the s8 best phone on the market. Don't even question the phone I am telling you their is no better flagship on the market than Samsung right now.
"Sofar, so good, I am on a learning curve, I am getting there."
"This is an awesome phone, this is my second time owning a Samsung Galaxy my previous phone was the galaxy S6. Before that it was an iPhone which I loved till it broke from there I went to the S6 and never looked back, Ive wanted this phone ever since there were rumors about it online."
"Made the switch from iPhone 7, a bit dubious at first as ive never had an android before, and im glad i did. The screen, Camera and speed are far superior to the iPhone. Also able to continue to use my icloud email address and apple music."
Overall amazing. The infinity screen is like no other out there. It was easy to make the change from my S7 with smart switch. It was like I still was using my old phone. No complaints about battery life so far. Can't wait to see what more it holds in store.
"Worth the wait. This phone exceeds expectations. Camera takes superior pics. Note of caution, the commuter otterbox case does not work well with this phone. With the case on you cannot swipe notifications from the top of the phone."
Don't ask me why i was the guinea pig. I was very happy with my Droid Turbo. The OTA update causes a DQA stopped error every 30 seconds. Can't believe samsung spends billions on marketing but clearly not enough on software engineering. Debating whether to keep it.
I've had the Galaxy S8 in my hands for three days. I was using the S5 so there hasn't been a large learning curve. I like the battery life so far. I used the Samsung Connect App to easily move most of my files over from my old phone.
"Excellent phone, battery life could be better but it's not bad for only having a 3000mah battery. Doesn't seem to lag as much as the s7 but usually Samsung phones slow down over time. Fingerprint sensor isn't as bad as all ""experts"" are claiming it to be."
"The all new Galaxy S8 is an amazing phone without a doubt. The screen is a work of art, has beautiful design and construction and has all the performance you need in a phone to do anything you'd reasonably want to do. Has no problem multitasking."
This phone is great easy to use Fast Love the camera and a picture I traded in iphone seven and I can't believe how much easier this one is to use than that iphone seven was without all the hassles and passwords and everything you need to make us an apple work I just love this phone my husband got...
"Coming from an S5, I'm grateful that I waited for this gorgeous device in the series -- it's simply striking. As for the dedicated Bixby key, we can only hope that Samsung comes through with a feature-rich assistant down the line."
"I just received this a few days ago and have been happily playing around with it. It's much lighter than previous phones, it has a sleek design and most importantly, it's very user friendly. Although the screen looks smaller than previous ones, it's not noticeable."
The Galaxy S8 is just an okay phone. The phone is a good size but the aspect ratio of the screen takes some getting used to. The resolution and camera are both great and the battery is just okay for a phone this size.
"The camera, display and hardware are what I would expect from a flagship device. If it was not for the software problem, I would have given the device a 5 star rating.  There is a software problem which I would not expect for a flagship device.. I received the phone on April 20."
We bought 2 Samsung X8s. After a weekend spent trying to get used to this phone I must report that I'm not impressed. Perhaps it's Android that I don't like because the phone hardware itself seems adequate enough though it's too big for my liking.
"The presumptive heir to the best Android crown is here: the Samsung Galaxy S8. A few years ago, the race to be the world’s favourite Android phone designer was wide-open. HTC would win it one year, and then LG would dazzle the next."
Got it quicker than expected ..like every other products bought from here ..thanks very
"So I am a dedicated Samsung fan, beyond mobile phones. I have only used the Galaxy mobile phone, since model 3, so I have seen all the changes.  Let's start with the good. The galaxy 8 has vibrant colors. The images/videos you watch are clear and natural looking."
"Very smooth transition except that I had to call and activate the number before turning on the phone. Directions did not say to do that first. Does not have a hotspot app like my S6. Trying to get direction on that from someone. Awesome screen, great size and feel."
"This is a great phone, Samsung stepped it up on this model it is very sleek and stunning it has a lot of cool features I do wish Bixby worked better but I guess I will see if they fix it"
Until now I don't have any problem with the features of the device. I really love it!!!
I had been due for an upgrade for a while and decided to wait for this phone to be released. Everything about this phone is fantastic and I couldn't be more pleased. It was so worth the wait!!!!
"Have used phone for one day, it's very fast and responsive. It's also very stunning. The long, sleek design makes it look futuristic and beautiful."
Good job on putting this phone together. Excited to explore my S8
"I had to give up my Note 7 and went back to my s5, then I heard the s8 was coming out, I was skeptical at first about pre ordering another Samsung phone but being a loyal Samsung user I went for it and received it 2 days earlier then the release date. after spending 72 hours with my s8 I love it!!"
"Day one and I am in love. I have been less enthused about my HTC 10, and got this bad boy as an early upgrade, and I am so glad I did. The phone is very user friendly I can't wait to unlock this phones full potential with extended use. The Galaxy S8 is sleek in design with amazing screen resolution."
This phone is not user friendly. To use the swipe on the right is hard and dysfunctional. I was so annoyed with the phone I only played on it for 10 minutes or so. I plan on returning it for another.
DIDNT EXPECT IT TO COME TODAY. ORDERED TWO. ONE WAS FOR ME AND ONE WAS FOR THE BRO
"Received today, wasn't expecting it till the 28th, all I can say it was worth the wait"
Over the moon with this purchase recommended to everybody
I like the phone a lot. i preordered the it on 4/6/17 and i seem to be having a lot of trouble getting my free VR headset with controller.
compared to my iphone 7 the phone is pretty much the same but does way more. it blows the iphone 7 away. i love to unlock my phone with my eyes
"I upgraded from my S5 & am really glad I did. No wasted space, extremely customizable, & transferring everything from my old phone was easy. The phone is *fast* & the camera is snappy! The battery life is good - and unlike my S5, I can barely even feel this phone get warm at all."
"It was my first time every buying a phone on a preorder, so I was worried that I might dislike some of the changes like widening of the screen that covers the whole phone.. But to my surprise, the phone looks slimmer and feels lighter than the S6 I was using - with bigger screen!"
It could be much better if it would come with 6gb RAM and a bit more battery. I agree that 10nm building process will reduce power consumption but still it is less considering the screen. The snapdragon 835 varient is not available in India.
I really love this phone. The design of the phone is awesome. Very easy to use. It's really sleek and has many great features for a new and recent smart-phone. I definitely recommend this device to android lovers.
"S8 is just a fabulous piece of art... Just beautifullllll, looks great in hand...awesome camera and phone is simply a beast in performance and good battery life.. Lag free UI and future proof...Simply superbbbbb display....."
"Not worth the stress of lack of security and most of all technical issues. If I was to wait best phone with lack of Samsung worries, wait for iPhone 8."
"Bright display, Realistic color, Durable, Lightweight, Built-in speakers"
This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. My S7 edge had a 3600 mah battery. With a bigger screen on the S8 and a smaller battery.
Great Device. Fantastic Resolution. The Camera is awesome and the soft touch key is fantastic. Overall a great phone.
Has some improvements over the S7 such as USB C so you can plug it in without trying to figure out which side goes where.
בהתחלה היתלבטתי בין הs8 לבין הg6 ובסוף הלכתי על הs8 ואני לא מתחרט לרגע מכשיר מדהים ואיכות מטורפת והמון פיצ'רים מגניבים ושימושיים

"DESIGN Il Galaxy S8 ha un design senza precedenti. Materiali con cui è realizzato sono vetro e metallo. Sia frontalmente e retro è presente il vetro , invece la cornice è di metallo. Troviamo nella parte destra tasto accensione e spegnimento, sulla sinistra tasto volume e tasto per richiamo Bixby."
"Gikk fra iPhone 6s til denne, og jeg er helt målløs! Det er vanskelig å finne noe som er feil eller man ikke liker ved telefonen."
In een woord geweldig!!!!
Seie seg vel sjøl at de e den beste telefonen eg har hatt med tanke på at den er så ny på markedet. Den er nok også den beste mobilen på markedet akkurat nå.  Kameraet er heilt rått! Den er kjapp og ser veldig fin ut.
"Dopo una settimana di utilizzo posso esprimere la mia opinione su questo gioiellino di casa samsung. Lo smartphone galaxy S8 e' il nuovo modello della samsung, oltre all' S8 e' disponibile il fratello maggiore S8+."
Avete presente come ci si sente quando si sta con qualcuno o si possiede qualcosa che sembra essere la cosa giusta? È così che mi sono sentita questi giorni con il Galaxy S8 in mano. Il nuovo top di gamma del brand sfoggia un design futuristico che si combina perfettamente con il 2017.
Het scherm is werkelijk magnifiek! Het toestel is een pareltje qua uiterlijk. Enkel de fingerprint is niet handig om te gebruiken. Mijn advies is om te wachten voor een nieuwe versie waar ze de fingerprint geÃ¯ntegreerd hebben in het scherm.
Gebruik al jaren Samsung maar de S8 is een echte topper.
"Top product! Zelf altijd met apple gewerkt maar dit is een machtig toestel! Mooi design,snel en kwaliteit display is gek!"
De aflevering is vlekkeloos gegaan . En andere dag geleverd.
"Heel erg mooi, geweldig scherm, top accu"
"Ik heb de telefoon nu een week in gebruik. Hij bevalt prima, reageert snel op commando's, fraai design. Het enige minpunt tot nu toe is dat de vingerafdrukscanner soms niet meteen werkt, maar dat je een aantal keren je vinger op de scanner moet leggen voordat die reageert."
Ik ben zeer tevreden over dit toestel. Hij is erg mooi en ligt zeer goed in de hand. De camera's zijn top en de gezichtsherkenningsfunctie werkt zeer smooth.
"Siirryin s6 edgestä tähän s8:iin. Mitään ylivoimaisen maata mullistavaa uudistusta ei s8 tarjoa vanhaan malliin nähden. Näyttö on hyvä ja iso. Näyttöön piilotettu ""päänäppäin"" ei ole niin kätevä kuin vanhanaikainen (ainakaan alkuun)."
"Siirryin s6 edgestä tähän s8:iin. Mitään ylivoimaisen maata mullistavaa uudistusta ei s8 tarjoa vanhaan malliin nähden. Näyttö on hyvä ja iso. Näyttöön piilotettu ""päänäppäin"" ei ole niin kätevä kuin vanhanaikainen (ainakaan alkuun)."
"Посмотрел очень много видеообзоров на телефон, даже в хрупких женских руках он выглядит потрясающе, а удлиненная форма никак не сказывается на удобстве пользования. Есть некоторое сомнения только по поводу сканера отпечатка пальца, к нему нужно будет привыкнуть, а так очень шикарный смартфон."
"Dici S8 e dici tutto, smartphone al top della categoria: Schermo eccezionale Fluidità nell'uso quotidiano, mai un rallentamento Fotocamera incredibile"
heb deze telefoon nu een week heb geen spijt van dat ik hem aangeschaft had eerst de s6 edge plus ben dus op kleiner model overgestapt de s8 deze s8 is geweldig
"Ik zat te twijfelen tussen de S8 en de S7 Edge. Ondanks de prijs heb ik toch voor de S8 gekozen en daar heb ik nog geen seconde spijt van gehad! Het design is fantastisch, het scherm is fantastisch en hij werkt fantastisch snel. Het ontbreken van de fysieke home knop is erg fraai opgelost."
"van het moment dat ik de S8 uit de verpakking haalde zag ik meteen de prachtige afwerking!toestel werkt heel vlot!enige minpuntjes zijn de batterij die geen dag mee gaat,wat bij de S7 wel het geval was(mss wel omdat ik er nu wel heel veel mee bezig ben)en het fijne toetsenbord,maar dat heb ik..."
top toestel mooie design mooie kleuren face unlock werkt erg goed iris scanner werkt ook prima maar gebruik ik niet vinger afdruk scanner vergt wat wenning maar als je een case erom heen hebt zal je niet snel met je vinger verkeerd zitten.
"Ik heb altijd Samsung gehad, was naar Iphone overgestaapt, maar geraakte er niet aan gewend. Voor mijn verjaardag de Galaxy S8 gekregen en SUPER tevreden mee. Veel gemakkelijker om mee te werken !!!"
Een leuk toestel met een knappe vormgeving en een vlotte bediening. Enkel het gebruik van de vingerafdruk vraagt wat oefening/gewenning.
Snel werkende telefoon met goede software.
Tot nu toe werkt de S8 zoals 'ie hoort te werken voor een smartphone in deze prijsklasse. De overstap verliep redelijk geruisloos.
"Ik had gehoopt dat met de S8 Samsung echt had geleerd van zijn ""fouten"" maar helaas slaat, in mijn mening, Samsung wederom de plank op een aantal fronten weer mis. het scherm zelf en de nieuwe schermverhouding is echt top. De van de Edge geÃ«rfde randen hadden van mij alleen echt niet gehoeven."
"Telefono bellissimo, e molto potente, tutto quello che volete ma i problemi li ha. Ho aspettato una buona settimana per scrivere questa recensione. Passando ad android da iPhone 6s è stata un'esperienza nella media, l'app smart switch non ha funzionato a dovere ( falliva al 20% via cavo) ho quindi..."
"Ottimo...design spettacolare, curato in tutti i particolari, molto intuitivo e facile da usare... da 5 stelle ma visto che si può sempre migliorare...... unica pecca il prezzo"
"Rozhodně nejlepší smartphone pro rok 2017, vytvořil jsem k němu i recenzi:"
"Всем рекомендую, очень хороший телефон, камера просто бомба по сравнению с айфон 7 !!!!"
"Аппарат понравился, здорово лежит в руке, отличная камера и быстродействие. Пока недостатков, если есть не заметил"
"За несколько дней недостатков не заметил: Отличная камера, Отличный дизайн Отличная сборка, Шикарный экран НА день активного пользования реально хватает! Молодцы SAMSUNG!"
"дизайн шикарен, в руке лежит идеально, достать экран одной рукой не проблема... память большая... камера отличная... приложения открываются мгновенно... батареи хватает на двое суток (ну для меня)... работает быстро и грамотно... понимает с полуслова!!! покупала в Эмиратах, там на 15000 дешевле))))"
"Не для кого не секрет что приложения становятся всё сложнее и сложнее и занимают больше места. По мне лучше бы самсунг выпускал телефоны со встроенной памятью, карту памяти покупать всёравно надо а хорошая стоит дорого, то на то и выходит, вот у меня galaxy s7 edge не все прилоения можно перенести..."
Omdat hij nu al.beter qua kwaliteit is als de s6 die ik had
"Na 8 jaar een iPhone te hebben gehad heb ik lang getwijfeld of ik nu voor een Samsung met Android zou gaan. Uiteindelijk het een kans gegeven, echter, ondanks dat het een zeer mooi toestel is (scherm kwaliteit beter dan de huidige iPhone), is de overstap van iOS naar Android toch een te 'grote'..."
Geen woorden voor. ZoÃ¶loog geweldig.
De Samsung werkt heel makkelijk en fijn. De camera kwaliteit is mooi.
"Doet wat beloofd word, dat is al heel wat."
"Erg fijn en snel toestel. Mooi scherm en aanpasbaar beeldscherm wat de levensduur van de batterij ten goede komt. erg veel leuke nieuwe dingen, zoals iris scan! (werkt overigens fantastisch goed)."
"Erg mooi toestel, welke lekker in de hand ligt. De irisscanner reageert voor mij niet snel genoeg, zeker buiten in daglicht lukt het helemaal niet. Gezicht scanner doet het wel erg snel, ik gebruik deze bijna altijd. Weliswaar niet echt veilig, maar het werkt wel gewoon goed."
Super toestel goede levering helemaal top!!
"Fantastisch scherm, veel geheugen, snel, eenvoudige bediening. Uitstekende aankoop."
"Bevalt me prima, jammer dat Bixby nog niet helemaal werkt naar behoren"
"Het toestel op de releasedag ontvangen van Coolblue (28 april) tot op heden zeer blij met het toestel. Makkelijk en snel in het gebruik, en een echte eyecatcher door het model en grote scherm."
"Tot nu toe zeer tevreden over de s8, nu bijna een week in gebruik. Mooi design, goede gebruiksduur van de batterij en de besturing is ook lekker snel. Het enigste min puntje is de plaats van de vingerafdruk scanner, ik kan hier nog nie aan wennen."
"Amazing screen, very easy to use, connects well with several peripherals, excellent smartwatch selection. Best camera in smartphones at the moment. Samsung was known to mess with the interface, but this time they have done it right. Very customizable, no bloatware."
"Het is zoals overal geschreven een mooi, strak en snel toestel. Het enige wat ik merk is dat de accu ongeveer een dagje meegaat, maar dat ligt denk ik ook wel aan mijn gebruik. Vergeleken met de S5 moet hij relatief snel aan het infuus."
Na 1 week heel tevreden over de S8.
Erg mooie telefoon met een geweldig scherm. Batterijduur kan beter maar is voldoende.
"Very comfortable, doesn't get stuck on pockets, looks like it's not even there. The spaces for camera, sensors and fingerprint scanner could be larger to make it easier to scan your fingerprint and check heart rate. Overall, the best I could find."
Ottimo prodotto è bellissimo esteticamente. L'unica cosa è che la nuova interfaccia di Samsung è troppo minimale e lo schermo presentava i bordi rossi. Per il resto nulla da dire e il venditore è stato gentile e cordiale. Sicuramente consigliato.

"Geweldig, beetje duur maar zeker waard"
Bevalt prima. Werkt snel en soepel. Meer instellingen. Handig is de instelling vertrouwde wifiomgeving zoals thuis. Dan is vegen voldoende om te ontgrendelen. Buitenshuis weer via beveiliging zoals vingerafdruk. Wachtwoord of patroon.
Prima telefoon met uitstekend scherm. S8 bevat veel verbeteringen tegenover de vorige modellen. Helaas accu wel nog steeds zwak.
Niet heel functioneel. Kent nog teveel beperkende vereisten.
Efter snart 3 veckors användning kan jag bara konstatera att min gamla Sony och alla andra lurar känns riktigt gammalmodiga. Helt enkelt - en RIKTIG GRYM lur!
"נתחיל בזאת שסמסונג הייתה החלוצה של מסך ללא מסגרת, ובמכשיר זה היא לקחה את זה צעד אחד קדימה. מלבד המסך המרהיב, ישנן כמה סוגיות שאני רוצה לציין בתור חובב סמארטפונים. אני הרגשתי שבמכשיר הזה הם לקחו צעד אחד ענק וקדימה ושתי צעדים קטנים אחורה."
Gikk fra S4 til S8 og er veldig fornøyd med kjøpet. Bruker alltid fingeravtrykk for å låse opp telefonen og merker nå at det er noe jeg må ha på alle...
"Gikk fra S4 til S8 og er veldig fornøyd med kjøpet. Bruker alltid fingeravtrykk for å låse opp telefonen og merker nå at det er noe jeg må ha på alle telefoner fremover. Batteriet er greit, bruker telefonen ganske ofte så lader den ca 1 gang om dagen. Veldig god skjerm og godt kamera."
"A mi me va fatal a la segunda vez que necesité carga no cargó, y ya no funciona."
"Har haft mobilen i bara 2dagar, och kan inte vara mer nöjd med den. +Batteri verkar hålla länge hade ca 40% kvar i slutet av dagen (som slutade ca kl 1på natten :) ) +Stor skärm +Kamera tar sjukt bra bilder även i dålig belysning."
Laten we voorop stellen dat de Samsung Galaxy S8 een luxe product is. Er zijn meer dan genoeg telefoons voor minder geld te krijgen waar de belangrijke specificaties overeenkomen met de Galaxy S8. Dat neemt echter niet weg dat de Galaxy S8 een fantastische telefoon is.
"Dit is niet gewoon de volgende Galaxy S, maar echt een compleet nieuwe telefoon. Je hebt eigenlijk bijna puur scherm aan de voorkant met nauwelijks telefoon er omheen met geweldige beeldkwaliteit. Het edge scherm maakt het helemaal af."
leuk apparaat maar ben even tevreden met galaxy s6
Jeg gir denne 5 stjerner fordi den leverer til de grader! Beste mobilen jeg noen sinne har hatt og den er rask og sikker.
"Snelle, mooie en gebruiksvriendelijke telefoon."
"geweldige telefoon, echter enorm krasgevoelig scherm. Wat hem dus knap waardeloos maakt omdat hij uit enkel scherm bestaat...."
"Het toestel is nog weer beter dan door voorgaande topmodellen van Samsung. Vooral de batterijduur is erg aangenaam. Daarnaast maakt het toestel prachtige foto's, ook na sterk inzoomen. En gewoon een prachtig design."
"Sto utilizzando questo telefono per lavoro, dopo un utilizzo abbastanza completo penso di poterne dare una opinione complessiva oggettiva e realistica. Si tratta dell'ultimo smartphone della samsung, l'ormai agognato dagli amanti del marchio S8."
"Confezione: All'interno della confezione di vendita troviamo una dotazione quasi completa che comprende: un paio di cuffiein-hear realizzate da AKG (di discreta qualità), un adattatore micro USB – Type C ed uno USB A – Type C, un cavo per la ricarica ed un alimentatore dotato di ricarca veloce con..."
"Mi sto trovando benissimo con questo nuovo modello del Galaxy S8, di seguito vi descrivo alcune prime impressioni durante il mio utilizzo in settimana. DISPLAY Il Samsung Galaxy S8 è dotato di un display da 5,8"" superAMOLED."
"Mooiste smartphone ooit die alle andere smartphones laat rood worden van schaamte. Het infinity display is gewoon magnifiek, om over het design nog te zwijgen. De processor is zoals je van een samsung vlaggenschip verwacht zeer snel. De batterij is ook veel beter dan ik had verwacht.."
"Nog beter dan de S7 ! super snel, prachtig en groot scherm Note: bestel er wel direct een hoesje bij (bijv Spigen van 15 eur is perfect) want zonder hoesje is de kans zeer reel aanwezig dat ie uit je handen glipt. hij is heel glad en nog iets langer dan de S7."
Top smartphone maar toch compact genoeg om hem in je broekzak mee te nemen. Snelheid duidelijk beter dan mijn S5.
Altijd tetreden geweest met Samsung en dat is nu niet anders. Het toestel draait zeer vlot en het scherm is het mooiste dat ik ooit gezien Heb! Graag nog wel Nederlandse ondersteuning voor bixby!
Hij is gewoon super mooi snel en fantastische camera
I don't have any complaints so far. It meets all my requirements. One of the most complete smart phone ever.
toestel voelt goed aan in de hand.
Mooie aankoop. Mooi design. Geweldige camera met scherpe fotos. Sneller en weer up to date.
"Samsung heeft weer eens een nieuwe telefoon uitgebracht voor het nieuwe jaar. Wederom worden we geconfronteerd met een flagship beast, werkelijk alles wat je maar wilt hebben. De Galaxy S8 heeft wat je nodig hebt, daarnaast zijn er nog de nieuwe snufjes zoals Bluetooth 5.0 (Eerste smartphone met..."
"Zeer mooi design, groot scherm"
"Het product is een beest en is het beste dat ik kan hebben momenteel om mijn zelfstandige zaak te ondersteunen. Alles werkt zoveel beter vergeleken met mijn vorige S5. Het scherm vind ik iets te nauw, en de keyboard letters zijn iets kleiner, maar algemeen levert het toestel uitstekend."
"Was een trouwe iPhone gebruiker, maar wegens gebrek aan innovatie overgeschakeld naar Samsung. Eerste dagen moeizaam maar nu zeer tevreden!"
Heel gemakelijk te gebruiken
"Ondertussen ben ik een week in bezit van deze Samsung S8, na upgrade van een HTC One M8. De prijs is niet mis, maar voor dat geld krijg je ook wel het neusje van de zalm in smartphoneland. Alles aan dit toestel voelt gewoon erg supreme en luxueus aan."
"Deze samsung s8 is een sumer toestel. Compatibiliteit met android is een echte aanrader. Gebruiksvriendelijk, stijlvol en supersnel. De foto's en video's zijn van suoerkwaliteit waardoor je zeker geen extra camera moet aanschaffen ."
"Uskomattoman hieno, helppo, nopea ja kaikkea muuta ylistystä; kunhan siihen tottuu. Siirryin s7 mallista tähän, suosittelen!"
"Fick hem denna underbara skönhet den 24/4 - 17 och är mer än nöjd med den. Design mässigt så är den helt fantastisk, med tanke på infinity skärmen så..."
"Na precies een week met de Galaxy S8+, tijd voor een iets uitgebreidere review. Ik heb de S8+ als opvolger van de S7 Edge die is doorgeschoven naar..."
"Na precies een week met de Galaxy S8+, tijd voor een iets uitgebreidere review. Ik heb de S8+ als opvolger van de S7 Edge die is doorgeschoven naar..."
Doet alles met een geweldige snelheid en nog mooier dan verwacht
indrukwekkende telefoon met alle snufjes zoals het zou moeten
Super mooie telefoon
"De handigheid is een must, hij is niet te groot en ook niet te klein. Ideaal voor in je hand."
Een weekje ver en heel blij met de aankoop. Ik geef de batterij 4 sterren omdat ik vind dat het stil aan tijd wordt dat de batterij van een gsm 2 of meerdere dagen moet mee gaan. De batterij gaat wel gemakkelijk 24u mee.
"Ik ben altijd al Samsung gehad als GSM, na de S5 nu de S8 gekocht, moet zeggen, mooi toestel en ligt hoe in mijn hand, de S8 is ook niet te groot,Topscherm"
"Ik vind het tot nu toe een heel erg aangenaam toestel. Licht in de hand, zeer goede kwaliteit van beeld, scherm en camera. Ook snelheid en geheugen opsla is geweldig. Enkel het toetsenbord is minder gebruiksvriendelijk."
"Ik vind het tot nu toe een heel erg aangenaam toestel. Licht in de hand, zeer goede kwaliteit van beeld, scherm en camera. Ook snelheid en geheugen opsla is geweldig. Enkel het toetsenbord is minder gebruiksvriendelijk."
"Ik vind het tot nu toe een heel erg aangenaam toestel. Licht in de hand, zeer goede kwaliteit van beeld, scherm en camera. Ook snelheid en geheugen opsla is geweldig. Enkel het toetsenbord is minder gebruiksvriendelijk."
Batterij duur top zit best veel op internet maar ik laad na twee dagen op. Ik heb nog geen min punt kunnen ontdekken
Samsung s8 is snel en zeer snelle procesor
is helder en snel en makkelijk in de hand ik ben er zeer blij mee ondanks mijn leeftijd is dit een zeer grote ervaring. blij dat ik er een gekocht heb
"Het toestel bevalt me zeer goed na een week gebruik ervan te kunnen maken. Het toestel ligt fijn in de hand, is razendsnel en heeft heel veel leuke functies. Het beeldformaat lijkt behoorlijk groot met 5'8 inch, maar door de minimale randen valt het formaat erg mee."
"Absolute eyecatcher en supersnelle alleskunner in 1. geweldig scherm, gebruiksgemak en mooi afgewerkt."
"Ik ben zeer tevreden van het toestel. Alles werkt snel, de camera maakt prachtige foto's en film kijken op het scherm is zeer aangenaam. De bijgeleverde oortjes leveren ook een heel goed geluid. Omdat de voorkant en achterkant van glas gemaakt zijn de telefoon veilig in een stevige case doen."
Het is een enorme upgrade van mijn galaxy s6. Het is een plezier om er naar te kijken qua design. De batterij gaat heel lang mee. Echt een aanrader!
Het is een fantastisch apparaat.
Had eerder een Windows phone. Weinig Apps. De enige reden om over te gaan was het gebrek aan Apps. Daarna als extra een Galaxy J50 gekocht. Kon niet concurreren met de Lumia. Vandaar maar gelijk dit keer het nieuwste model van Samsung.
Het is heel mooi en snel. Kan goed met de splitscreen werken en zo sneller iets leren of lezen
"Prachtig toestel. Zowel het design van buiten, als de rekenkracht binnenin het toestel verbazen. Toestel laat zeer snel op via de USB-c poort, waardoor de capaciteit van de batterij minder stoort."
hij doet alles wat je verwacht
"Heb de 6s egdeen 7s edge gehad maar de 8s... das iets nieuws! Mooi design lijkt op een prototype zonder dag melijke logo vanvoor. Snel,gebruiksvriendelijk, en een goede camera op zak"
Zit niet zo veel verschil op dan de S7
De telefoon komt vrij makkelijk uit de case. Ik heb dan ook steeds het gevoel dat hij er wel uit kan vallen als je even niet oplet.
"Kjøpte den for 3 dager siden, den går sømløst og kameraet er veldig bra!"
"Memória ótima, não trava de jeito algum, câmera extremamente boa, simplesmente o melhor celular que comprei até hoje."
"Deze smartphone is een streling voor het oog. Het display is prachtig. De prestaties van de smartphone zijn ook ruim voldoende, wat je verwacht van een flagship van Samsung. De batterijduur kan een probleem zijn voor zeer zware gebruikers."
"Deze smartphone heeft alle hardware features waar ik nood aan heb: wireless charging, smal design met 1 hand te bedienen, waterdicht en Bluetooth 5.0 met dual-connection. Vooral de bluetooth en wireless charging zijn sterke punten."
Batterij gaat erg lang mee wat erg fijn is. De camera is ook super goed hij laat soms iets te veel details zien (denk aan: wallen/puisten haha). Verder werkt alles super snel en kan je makkelijk twee applicaties tegelijk op het scherm uitvoeren.
het is een top product en zeker een aanrader!
"Heerlijk smartphone om mee te werken. Deze is snel, mooi, prachtig groot oled-scherm. Ik ben blij dat ik de S8 Plus niet gekozen heb, deze is zeker groot en snel genoeg. De batterij gaat de hele dag mee."
Super handig in gebruik en zeer snelle processor en groot scherm
"Het feit dat de knoppen zijn verdwenen is zeker geen nadeel alleen een aanpassing, de vingerafdrukscanner die naar de achterkant is verplaatst is alleen maar een voordeel."
"De samsung galaxy S8 bevalt mij erg goed! Ik had hiervoor een S6, die me ook goed beviel. Deze telefoon is snel, heeft een mooi design? de camera is nog beter dan die van zijn voorgangers (en misschien wel beter dan de iPhone). Kortom; ik ben zeer tevreden met mijn nieuwe telefoon!"
"Natuurlijk gebruik je veel apps en internet, dus ik vind de batterij duur toch wat tegenvallen. Maar verder fijn toestel."
Tot nu toe in de eerste dagen weinig tot geen minpunten aan te geven.
Tot nu toe in de eerste dagen weinig tot geen minpunten aan te geven.
Wat een huge scherm!
"De S8 is super snel, mooi lang en zeer goede kwaliteit scherm. Android 7 ziet er strak uit ook het menu is netjes geordend. Camera werkt zeer snel en de foto's zijn van goede kwaliteit, zelfs in het donker met flitser. Batterijduur is zeer goed vooral in vergelijk met de voorganger."
"mooi design, oogt sterk en robuust en elegant tegelijk"
Supersnel toestel. Vernieuwend design.
Groot scherm. Makkelijk te bedienen.
"Ik ben een fan van samsung, overgestapt van S6 edge naar deze S8. S8 is beduidend sneller en heeft een iets groter scherm als de S6. Het is een heel fijn en prettig toestel. Ben hem nu een paar dagen aan het gebruiken en moet de ondekkingsreis nog afmaken. Veel nieuwe dingen te ontdekken."
"Fijn toestel, makkelijk in gebruik. Design is top en toestel ligt goed in de hand. Standaard toetsenbord is iets minder, maar er zijn genoeg alternatieven beschikbaar."
"Ik vind de Samsung Galaxy S8 een van de best vooruitstrevende Galaxy's ooit geproduceerd. De S8 overtreft Apple op alle vlakken, dus als je waar voor je geld wilt, koop een Samsung Galaxy S8!"
"Mooi toestel,maar vind m zelf net iets te smal. Had beter qua breedte hetzelfde moeten zijn als de Galaxy S7. Maar wil Cool blue nog wel even een pluim geven voor de omruil actie die bij de Galaxy s8 behoord."
"Het toestel heb ik nu een week in huis en bevalt uitstekend.. Mijn vorige toestel was een S6 Edge, dus wat dat betreft was het qua software redelijk bekend terrein., wel is de schil van Samsung echt voorruit gegaan en neigt nu een stuk meer naar stock android."
"De accuduur is OK en opladen gaat snel. De telefoon bestuurt soepel. Maar bovenal: het is zonder twijfel de mooiste smartphone die ik ooit heb gezien. Iets dat me niet was opgevallen tot ik de telefoon in handen had, is dat de hoeken van het scherm niet recht zijn."
Echt een top telefoon! Lekker snel gebruiksvriendelijk. Echt een verbetering van alle andere telefoons. Kortom zoek je een nieuwe telefoon en geen iphone lief hebben. Neem dan de S8!!
Zeer snelle telefoon met voldoende standaard geheugen. Foto's zijn heel scherp en kan met de meeste apps multitasken.
Maakt mooie foto's. Is super snel. Voortreffelijk beeld.
"Altijd al samsung gehad, deze is weer sneller mooier beeld en de batterij gaat langer mee."
Ik heb de Plus besteld vooral omdat de accu groter is en ik beklaag mij dit geen seconde. Een buitengewone scherm met een aanneembare footprint. Samsung is erin geslaagd om een design voor te stellen die 2 generaties vooruit is op de concurrentie.
"Beste telefoon tot nu toe. Hiervoor een S6 Edge gehad, maar dit is toch een grote stap vooruit. Perfecte beeldkwaliteit. Alleen de home button is niet altijd even handig. Als je de telefoon uit je broekzak pakt, bedien je de telefoon soms onbedoeld."
"Mijn vorige gsm was een s6 edge. Het verschil vind ik persoonlijk zeer klein. Scherm was al heel goed en is niet zichtbaar verbeterd, is ook iets dikker en zwaarder geworden. Foto's rear camera waren al heel goed dus zo n grote sprongen zijn er niet gemaakt."
De Samsung S8 is een mooi toestel .Hij ligt lekker in de hand .De besturing werkt super snel alleen even wenen aan de nieuwe look van de besturing .Er is veel in te stellen verders geen klachten over het toestel ..Ging van een S6 naar S8 en er zit heel veel verschil in..
"Hij is makkelijk in gebruik, super snel, en alles werkt mooi met elkaar mee."
Ondanks vingerprint scanner op de achterkant toch veel gebruikt Zeer strak goed in de hand liggend design.
"Na jaren een iPhone te hebben gebruikt nu maar eens overgestapt op deze samsung S8 waarom? omdat ik een groter scherm wilde hebben maar geen groter telefoon. Deze samsung S8 is echt geweldig scherm, design, beeld grote enz."
Top telefoon. Ligt goed in de hand en ik vind persoonlijk de plaatsing van de vingerafdrukscanner perfect. Alles is met 1 hand te bedienen. Alleen de Bixby knop is verschrikkelijk. Je klikt er vaak per ongeluk op en er zit geen info achter.
De galaxy s8 is een prachtige telefoon met uitstekende beel kwaliteit. Is zeer snel. Camera nu ook met bewegende objecten uitstekend.vingerafdruk bevindt zich op de perfecte plaats.geluidskwaliteit is iets minder maar beter dan de s7 maar mocht iets luider gaan.
"De mobiel maakt prachtige foto's, heeft een mooie grijze kleur en ligt goed in de hand. Geweldig dat er een blauwlichtfilter ingebouwd is."
"Ik ben overgestapt van Windows Phone en Android is zeker even wennen, maar de snelheid en het scherm zijn waanzinnig. Ook de GearVR is een leuke gadget erbij"
Ben en blijf een samsungliefhebber
"De s8 heeft een mooi design, snelheid is goed en batterij gaat de hele dag mee. Het formaat is precies goed en houd goed in de hand."
"Toestel is t.o.v. de S6 veel verbeterd door de waterdichtheid, sd kaart optie en verbeterde accuduur"
Snel uitgebreid mooi
Het enige minpunt vind ik de nieuwe Android en de Samsung software. Deze bevatten veel nieuwe instellingen waardoor er regelmatig een pop-up verschijnt waar een keuze gemaakt dient te worden. En gisteren bleek de browser opeens altijd binnen mijn Lastpass app (wachtwoordkluis) geopend te worden.
Het is groter dan mijn s5 en sneller
batterij gaat veel langer mee. mooi helder en goed kwaliteit beeld. perfecte camera. ligt lekker in de hand. hij is alleen wel heel glad
Tot nu toe is het een prima telefoon. Hij voldoet aan de verwachtingen die je van deze smartphone hebt en overtreft het ook. Hij is licht en het formaat is precies goed. Daardoor ligt het toestel prettig in de hand. Het scherm is echt heel mooi en de weergave erop ook.
De nieuwe vinger afdruk scanner werkt erg goed
Beste toestel dat ik al heb gehad. Fantastisch scherm heel snel in gebruik en ondanks kleinere batterij(3000 mh) toch goede batterij duur. 1 minpunt zoals iedereen dat vind de vingerdrukscanner op de verkeerde plaats. En de gezichts verificatie is goed en snel maar in het donker niet zo effectief.
Mooie en snelle telefoon. Prima gebruiksgemak
"Mooi product, erg snel en ook fijn in gebruik. Echter 1x laten vallen en mijn scherm is kapot. Normaal kan is dat geen probleem, alleen nu is de telefoon meteen ONBRUIKBAAR. De voorgangers die ik ook allemaal had konden wel tegen een stootje."
"Het toestel is erg prachtig, erg snel en maakt fantastische foto's. Het gebruik is even wennen ten opzichte van de s7(de home knop is weg en het menu met alle apps open je door op het startscherm naar boven te swipen), maar dat went snel"
"Het is gewoonweg een prachtig toestel dat heel intuÃ¯tief aanvoelt. Ik had weinig moeite met overgang van htc (enkel de knoppen van het volume en de 2 knoppen naast de homeknop die omgedraaid zijn, maar ook dat went..). De bediening verloopt vlotjes, eigenlijk weinig tot geen happering waarneembaar."
"Meest kwaliteitsvolle smartphone op de markt. Prachtig design en zeer helder scherm. Groot scherm, maar door de smalle randen lijkt de smartphone niet te groot."
"Geweldige telefoon, zowel van design als van performance. Ziet er super uit, zeer gebruiksvriendelijk en met de batterij kom je vlot de dag door."
Het is een zeer mooie en een snelle apparaat.
"Mooie, snellere uitvoering met groter scherm. Uitbreidbaar geheugen, snelle installatie (vanaf 'oudere' Samsung)"
"Moving from an S7 edge this rocks even more. Get a while to get used to the new hardware - home button, fingerprint sensor, but it's a great phone, love it."
"Ik heb de Samsung Galaxy S8 nu bijna een week in gebruik, en het is echt een toptoestel. Hoewel de prijs hoog ligt ben ik ervan overtuigd dat het toestel de prijs waard is. Na mijn Galaxy S5, S6, S7 Edge was dit een logische vervolgstap, en Samsung heeft wederom stappen kunnen maken in look & feel,..."
Mooiste telefoon die ik tot nu heb gehad.
"Een zeer mooie, handige, praktische gsm met leuke en bruikbare gadgets..."
"This is an impressive smartphone. I only have it for a few days so I cannot attest of its robustness or battery durability. The phone is thin, fits well in hand, and the new ""integrated"" home button is impressively well made."
Het is altijd even wennen van een S6 Edge naar een S8 overstappen; maar na een paar dagen blijkt het gebruik wel logisch opgebouwd; schermkwaliteit is zeer goed en het feit dat het scherm voor de volle 100% gebruikt wordt en je geen druktoetsen meer hebt (enkel touch) is handiger in gebruik.
Mijn ervaring is zoals gewoonlijk met Samsung telefoons zeer positief.
"Ligt lekker in de hand, mooie en groot beeld, lekker snel en lange accu duur"
Tot op heden perfect
Tot op heden perfect
Fantastische telefoon. Op het moment geen betere verkrijgbaar. Erg mooi beeldscherm.
"Ik heb de overstap terug gemaakt van IOS naar Android en het bevalt prima! De batterij gaat 1,5 dag mee bij veel gebruik, en er is meer dan voldoende geheugen beschikbaar in het toestel. Het is even wennen met de navigatieknoppen en de vingerafdruk scanner maar dat gaat al snel goed."
Gewoon Top toestel....
heel mooi en handig
"Heb de telefoon nu een week in gebruik en nog steeds erg blij met de aankoop. Normaal is bij een nieuw apparaat het nieuwe er wel van af na een aantal dagen, maar bij deze telefoon is dat voor mij niet het geval. Vooral het scherm blijft verbazen."
"Snel in gebruik. Erg mooi design door de grote van het scherm en het integreren van de ""home button"" in het touch screen."
Heel mooi toestel. Had hiervoor de S6 Edge. Deze is wel groter. Ga denk ik niet meer terug naar de iPhone. Het toestel voelt prettig in de hand en alles werkt perfect en intuitief.
Erg mooie Telefoon met echt veel mooie opties. Vooral het beeld is echt schitterend en loopt geheel door over het hele scherm! Ook met spellen echt super! Alles laad lekker makkelijk en soepel. Ook erg fijn dat eraan gedacht is om alles makkelijk over te zetten van de ene telefoon naar de andere.
Toestel met een prachtig design. Het volledige scherm is ook een geweldig voordeel. TopToestel
"Mooi design. oude samsung voelt nu al ouderwets aan. wil er geen hoesje omheen, omdat dat het hele punt van het design teniet zou doen. Ik ben wel bang dat de onhandige handjes hem nog wel eens zou kunnen laten vallen en omdat het scherm tot aan de randen doorloopt, kan ik me voorstellen dat dat..."
"Mooie telefoon. Na een week nog niet alle mogelijkheden ontdekt, maar werkt heerlijk. Nog beter dan de 6edge die ik hiervoor had."
Een aantal dagen in gebruik en alleen maar lof voor deze mooie Samsung smartphone!
Het ontwerp van de telefoon is prachtig. Mooi en super scherp scherm is fijn in gebruik.
"Toestel ligt goed in de hand , werkt snel en heeft goeie en toffe camera mogelijkheden"
Pas een paar dagen in huis maar bevalt prima. De batterij gaat bij gemiddeld/weinig gebruik makkelijk 3 dagen mee.
Maakt mooi foto's Heel erg snel met verbinding .
Goeie aankoop perfecte telefoon veel nieuwe opties krachtige processor ....zeer gestroomlijnd scherm terug waterdicht en eindelijk makkelijk terug let geheugenkaart
Beste toestel van deze tijd
"Super gsm, future proof!"
"Super mooi, snel en groot beeld in een handzaam formaat."
"Als vervanging van de Galaxy S5 is dit een geweldige telefoon, qua design en bouwkwaliteit heeft het me echt verbaast. Prachtige afwerking van de Edge randen dat bijna naadloos overloopt op de metalen zijkant, dit alles maakt het dan ook een pracht van een telefoon met een fijne ligging in de hand."
ligt goed in de hand en is niet te groot. fraai design.
Mooi en snel toestel
Case is goed maar geen pasjes erin doen.
's avonds om het scherm te ontgrendelen gezicht niet god
"De Galaxy S8 is een zeer snelle en fijne telefoon. Alles is zo verfijnd gedesigned dat iedereen er mee te pas kan. Het gebolde scherm valt precies goed, en met de vingerafdrukscanner achterop kan je lekker snel en veilig aan de gang. De accuduur van de S8 is prima."
Wat een huge scherm!
Fijne telefoon. Makkelijk in gebruik. Helder scherm. Lijkt stuk smaller zonder de randen
Super mooi beeldscherm en goede camera
"Prachtig product: snel, innovatief, krachtig en het werkt allemaal perfect. Ik gebruikte iOS, maar de software die op de s8 draait werkt uitmuntend."

Denne telefonen er fantastisk. Det er ein god telefon som passer bra i hånden. Kamera bak og framme er utrulig bra du får alle detaljer med i bildene dine. Den tåler ein del vann så den er perfekt for ein som liker å vere ute.
Ik heb hem nu al 4 dagen en ik ben er zeer blij mee. Ik raad wel aan om een case en een screenprotector te kopen omdat de hele telefoon van glas is.
"De Samsung Galaxy 8 is een zeer handzaam toestel. Het voelt wel plastic aan, maar het is Samung vergeven. Het scherm is zeer zeer scherp. De kleuren ietwat verzadigd, maar dat is bekend bij Samsung. Ook wanneer je het display op 'basis' zet, ontbreekt het niet aan erg felle kleuren."
Hyvä puhelin. Helppo käyttää. Näyttää hyvältä ja on käytännöllinen puhelin.
Jag har haft s3 till s8 och s8 är makalöst bra i allt. Kameran slår separata digitalkameror.

"Pent design men den har noen ting som ikke er bra enda. Fingeravtrykks sensoren er plassert ganske dust , og er ikke så kjapp og sikker som andre sine. Er vanskelig å finne og kjenne om du er på rett plass. Har brukt Google Now launcher men den fungerer ikke skikkelig på denne telefonen."
"Nå har jeg akkurat mottatt denne telefonen, men er veldig fornøyd så langt. Utrolig lekkert design. Den er litt glatt, noe som er litt uvant fra min forrige. Fikk også en overraskelse da jeg trengte nano sim kort, det hadde jeg ikke klart å få med meg, så måtte vente et par dager ekstra på det..."

"Jag är supernöjd med telefonen, den har uppfyllt mina förväntningar."

"Ik heb de Galaxy S8 nu een paar dagen in bezit en kom van een Galaxy S6. Wat meteen opvalt is hoe compact het toestel aanvoelt, doordat het iets smaller (maar ook iets langer) is en doordat de hoeken afgerond zijn."
"En telefon jag gillar mycket. Lite konstigt att läsa av fingeravtryck på baksidan, krävs träning men börjar lära mig :) och går smidigt. Egentligen tycker jag inte om Edge, de böjda kanterna, men det passar verkligen designen perfekt."
"Yo tenía el S7 y noto la deferencia con el S8 mejor calidad de imagen y fluidez, la batería aguanta todo el día de sobra. Buena comprar"
top samsung s8 galaxy ...livraison rapide ....produit original .......... je recommande ce produit ............................................................................................................................
Eerst en vooral bewijst Coolblue hun klantvriendelijkheid door alsnog te zorgen dat de S8 tijdig geleverd werd (Coolblue vandaag nog) nadat deze niet verzonden was op de 19/04. Nu over het toestel. 1 woord prachtig. Het scherm is lekker ruim maar de gsm voelt in je hand super klein aan.
